Earlier, an order was issued where it was declared that the properties at these addresses were being used for carrying out activities of PFI and its associates. PFI , its associates and affiliates have been declared as unlawful associations by the central government through a notification on September 27 and a five-year ban was imposed.In September, the Centre banned PFI for five years, accusing the Islamic outfit of having 'links' with global terror groups such as ISIS and and trying to spread communal hatred in the country. The PFI's eight associates--Rehab India Foundation, Campus Front of India, All India Imams Council, National Confederation of Human Rights Organisation, National Women's Front, Junior Front, Empower India Foundation and Rehab Foundation, Kerala -- were also placed in the list of the organisations outlawed under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), according to a gazette notification.ALSO READ| Why has the Centre banned Popular Front of India?The ban came after the National Investigating Agency(NIA), the Enforcement Directorate(ED) and various state police forces carried out raids in a massive pan-India crackdown on the PFI twice in the recent days.A total of 106 leaders and activists of the PFI were arrested in 15 states on September 22 for allegedly supporting terror activities in the country.

The rapper is all set to use his street knowledge as strength to set his journey inside.\u201cI have no idea where this journey will take me.

He shared, \u201cI want to clear some controversies and want to experience this new world. People usually have a lot of misconceptions about me because of the way I talk, maybe.

    "content": "The beginning of October means Nobel Prize season. Six days, six prizes, new faces from around the globe added to the world\u2019s most elite roster of scientists, writers, economists and human rights leaders.This year\u2019s Nobel season kicks off Monday with the medicine award, followed by daily announcements: physics on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The 2022 Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday and the economics award on Oct. 10.Here are five other things to know about the coveted prizes:The prizes in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace were established by the will of Alfred Nobel, a wealthy Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite. The first awards were handed out in 1901, five years after Nobel\u2019s death.Also Read | Mangalyaan quietly bids goodbye: India's maiden Mars mission runs out of fuelEach prize is worth 10 million kronor (nearly $900,000) and will be handed out with a diploma and gold medal on Dec. 10 -- the date of Nobel\u2019s death in 1896.The economics award \u2014 officially known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel \u2014 wasn\u2019t created by Nobel, but by Sweden\u2019s central bank in 1968.Between 1901 and 2021, the Nobel Prizes and the prize in economic sciences have been awarded 609 times.The Nobel statutes prohibit the judges from discussing their deliberations for 50 years. So it\u2019s probably going to be a while before we know for sure how judges made their picks for 2022 and who was on their short lists.The judges try hard to avoid dropping hints about the winners before the announcements, but sometimes word gets out. Bookies in Europe sometimes offer odds on possible peace prize and literature Nobel winners.Also Read | Syukuro Manabe, Klaus Hasselmann, Giorgio Parisi win 2021 Nobel Prize in PhysicsThousands of people around the world are eligible to submit nominations for the Nobel Prizes.They include university professors, lawmakers, previous Nobel laureates and the committee members themselves.Although the nominations are kept secret for 50 years, those who submit them sometimes announce their suggestions publicly, particularly for the Nobel Peace Prize.The Nobel Peace Prize is presented in Norway, while the other awards are handed out in Sweden. That\u2019s how Alfred Nobel wanted it.Also Read | Benjamin List, David WC MacMillan win 2021 Nobel Prize in ChemistryHis exact reasons are unclear but during his lifetime Sweden and Norway were joined in a union, which was dissolved in 1905. Sometimes relations have been tense between the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, which manages the prize money, and the fiercely independent peace prize committee in Oslo.Patience, for one.Scientists often have to wait decades to have their work recognized by the Nobel judges, who want to make sure that any breakthrough withstands the test of time.That\u2019s a departure from Nobel\u2019s will, which states that the awards should endow \u201cthose who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind.\u201d The peace prize committee is the only one that regularly rewards achievements made in the previous year.According to Nobel\u2019s wishes, that prize should go to \u201cthe person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.\u201dAlso Read | Winners of Nobel Prize 2021 in Medicine and their discovery",

    "content": "The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court has ruled that a woman who leaves her matrimonial home before her divorce cannot later seek \"right to residence\" under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (DV Act), even if her appeal against the divorce decree is pending.The man and woman married on June 10, 2015, and the husband and his family claimed that the wife was very rude and left their house on her own accord after a few months of marriage.The woman then moved a magistrate's court under the Domestic Violence (DV) Act, and the court ordered the husband to pay interim maintenance of Rs 2,000 per month as well as rent of Rs 1500 per month for the woman to make her own living arrangements.The woman challenged this order before the Udgir Sessions Court, which modified the order and directed the husband as well as his parents to give her accommodation in the shared household. The shared household was in the name of the husband\u2019s father, as he had bought it out of his own savings.The husband\u2019s parents had then approached the high court, but Justice Sandipkumar More said it is now settled that \"even if the shared household stands in the name of in-laws, the wife can very well claim a residence order in respect of such a shared household.\"However, the bench noted that in this case, the man and woman's marriage had been dissolved in July 2018. Thus, the husband's parents claimed in the high court that since the woman is a divorced wife, she cannot claim a residence order or enforce an earlier residence order that was issued during her marriage to their son.The woman, on the other hand, said that the divorce was obtained through fraud by the husband, and so she had filed an appeal against it.Justice More noted that Section 17 of the DV Act allows right to residence, but the same is only true when the woman continues to reside in the shared household before the divorce.\"As such, the divorced wife cannot resort to the earlier residence order when her marriage with her husband has been dissolved by a divorce decree passed by the court having proper jurisdiction and especially when she had already left their shared household four years ago. Under the circumstances, she is not even entitled to the relief of restraining dispossession since she is not in possession of the shared household,\" the bench opined.\"Mere pendency of an appeal will not come in the way of the present applicants challenging the order passed by the magistrate,\" Justice More added.\"Therefore, I come to the conclusion that she, being a divorced wife, is not entitled to claim a residence order or the implementation of an earlier residence order in the light of changed circumstances, i.e., after her subsequent divorce for occupying the shared household after leaving the same long ago and prior to her divorce. I am of the opinion that the Magistrate has definitely erred in directing the applicants to provide one room to her in the shared household,\" the bench held.Read | Divorce laws around the world",

As the satellite battery is designed to handle an eclipse duration of only about one hour and 40 minutes, a longer eclipse would drain the battery beyond the safe limit,\u201d PTI reported, quoting unnamed sources.Also Read | Nasa to raise Hubble telescope's orbit, over a decade after humans last visited itThe mission had already exceeded expectations as it remained operational for over eight years when it was designed for a six-month-long mission around Martian orbit.Mangalyaan was launched in 2013 onboard PSLV-C25 as the first interplanetary mission from India, making Isro the fourth space agency in the world to launch such a mission beyond Earth's orbit. The spacecraft was a demonstration mission aimed at establishing that India could design, launch and operate a mission on another world.Developed at just Rs 450 crore, the mission to Mars from India was one of the most cost-effective interplanetary missions ever designed.The spacecraft was equipped with five instruments to study the Martian surface features, morphology, mineralogy and the Martian atmosphere. The five instruments included the Mars Color Camera (MCC), Thermal Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (TIS), Methane Sensor for Mars (MSM), Mars Exospheric Neutral Composition Analyser (MENCA) and Lyman Alpha Photometer (LAP).Also Read | When two ancient floods submerged Mars\"MOM is credited with many laurels like cost-effectiveness, a short period of realisation, economical mass-budget, and miniaturisation of five heterogeneous science payloads\", ISRO officials pointed out.India has been planning to launch another mission to Mars in the coming years, which is also likely to be an Orbiter. Former Isro chief K Sivan, during his tenure in 2021, said Mangalyaan-2 will be undertaken only after the launch of Chandrayaan-3, India's upcoming Moon mission. He added that the space agency had asked the scientific community for suggestions on possible experiments and it is in the process of receiving these.The second Mars mission remains on the drawing board for now.Also Read | For our dinosaurs: Earth strikes back as Dart bangs asteroid in epic mission",

    "content": "The first time the Russian soldiers caught him, they tossed him bound and blindfolded into a trench covered with wooden boards for days on end.Then they beat him, over and over: Legs, arms, a hammer to the knees, all accompanied by furious diatribes against Ukraine. Before they let him go, they took away his passport and Ukrainian military ID \u2014 all he had to prove his existence \u2014 and made sure he knew exactly how worthless his life was.\u201cNo one needs you,\u201d the commander taunted. \u201cWe can shoot you any time, bury you a half-meter underground and that\u2019s it.\u201dThe brutal encounter at the end of March was just the start. Andriy Kotsar would be captured and tortured twice more by Russian forces in Izium, and the pain would be even worse.Russian torture in Izium was arbitrary, widespread and absolutely routine for both civilians and soldiers throughout the city, an Associated Press investigation has found. While torture was also evident in Bucha, that devastated Kyiv suburb was only occupied for a month. Izium served as a hub for Russian soldiers for nearly seven months, during which they established torture sites everywhere.Based on accounts of survivors and police, AP journalists located 10 torture sites in the town and gained access to five of them. They included a deep sunless pit in a residential compound with dates carved in the brick wall, a clammy underground jail that reeked of urine and rotting food, a medical clinic, a police station and a kindergarten.The AP spoke to 15 survivors of Russian torture in the Kharkiv region, as well as two families whose loved ones disappeared into Russian hands. Two of the men were taken repeatedly and abused. One battered, unconscious Ukrainian soldier was displayed to his wife to force her to provide information she simply didn\u2019t have.The AP also confirmed eight men were killed under torture in Russian custody, according to survivors and families. All but one were civilians.At a mass grave site created by the Russians and discovered in the woods of Izium, at least 30 of the 447 bodies recently excavated bore visible marks of torture \u2014 bound hands, close gunshot wounds, knife wounds and broken limbs, according to the Kharkiv regional prosecutor\u2019s office. Those injuries corresponded to the descriptions of the pain inflicted upon the survivors.AP journalists also saw bodies with bound wrists at the mass grave. Amid the trees were hundreds of simple wooden crosses, most marked only with numbers. One said it contained the bodies of 17 Ukrainian soldiers. At least two more mass graves have been found in the town, all heavily mined, authorities said.A physician who treated hundreds of Izium\u2019s injured during the Russian occupation said people regularly arrived at his emergency room with injuries consistent with torture, including gunshots to their hands and feet, broken bones and severe bruising, and burns. None would explain their wounds, he said.\u201cEven if people came to the hospital, silence was the norm,\u201d chief Dr Yuriy Kuznetsov said. He added that one soldier came in for treatment for hand injuries, clearly from being cuffed, but the man refused to say what happened.Men with links to Ukrainian forces were singled out repeatedly for torture, but any adult man risked getting caught up. Matilda Bogner, the head of the UN human rights mission in Ukraine, told the AP they had documented \u201cwidespread practices of torture or ill-treatment of civilian detainees\u201d by Russian forces and affiliates. Torture of soldiers was also systemic, she said.Torture in any form during an armed conflict is a war crime under the Geneva Conventions, whether of prisoners of war or civilians.\u201cIt serves three purposes,\u201d said Rachel Denber of Human Rights Watch. \u201cTorture comes with questionsabout coercing information,but it is also to punish and to sow fear. It is to send a chilling message to everyone else.\u201dAP journalists found Kotsar, 26, hiding in a monastery in Izium, his blond hair tied back neatly in the Orthodox fashion and his beard curling beneath his chin. He had no way to safely contact his loved ones, who thought he was dead.Back in March, after his first round of torture, Kotsar fled to the gold-domed Pishchanskyi church. Russian soldiers were everywhere, and nowhere in Izium was safe.Hiding amid the icons, Kotsar listened to the rumble of Russian armored vehicles outside and contemplated suicide. He had been a soldier for just under a month and had no idea if anyone in his little unit had survived the Russian onslaught.When he emerged from the church a few days later, a Russian patrol caught him. They kept him for a week. His captors\u2019 idea of a joke was to shave his legs with a knife, and then debate aloud whether to slice off the limb entirely.\u201cThey took, I don\u2019t know what exactly, some iron, maybe glass rods, and burned the skin little by little,\u201d he said.He knew nothing that could help them. So they set him free again, and again he sought refuge with the monks. He had nowhere else to go.By then, the church and monastery compound had become a shelter for around 100 people, including 40 children. Kotsar took up a version of the monastic life, living with the black-robed brothers, helping them care for the refugees and spending his free hours standing before the gilt icons in contemplation.In the meantime, Izium was transforming into a Russian logistical hub. The town was swarming with troops, and its electricity, gas, water and phone networks were severed. Izium was effectively cut off from the rest of Ukraine.It was also in the spring that the Russians first sought out Mykola Mosyakyn, driving down the rutted dirt roads until they reached the Ukrainian soldier\u2019s fenced cottage. Mosyakyn, 38, had enlisted after the war began, though not in the same unit as Kotsar.They tossed him into a pit with standing water, handcuffed him and hung him by the restraints until his skin went numb. They waited in vain for him to talk, and tried again.\u201cThey beat me with sticks. They hit me with their hands, they kicked me, they put out cigarettes on me, they pressed matches on me,\u201d he recounted. \u201cThey said, \u2018Dance,\u2019 but I did not dance. So they shot my feet.\u201dAfter three days, they dropped him near the hospital with the command: \u201cTell them you had an accident.\u201dAt least two other men from Mosyakyn\u2019s neighborhood, a father and son who are both civilians, were taken at the same time. The father speaks about his two weeks in the basement cell in a whisper, staring at the ground. His adult son refuses to speak about it at all.That family, along with another man who was also tortured in the basement cell on Izium\u2019s east bank, spoke on condition of anonymity. They are terrified the Russians will return.Mosyakyn was captured again by a different Russian unit just a few days later. This time, he found himself in School No. 2, subject to routine beatings along with other Ukrainians. AP journalists found a discarded Ukrainian soldier\u2019s jacket in the same blue cell he described in detail. The school also served as a base and field hospital for Russian soldiers, and at least two Ukrainian civilians held there died.But the soldiers again freed Mosyakyn. To this day, he doesn\u2019t know why.Nor does he understand why they\u2019d release him just to recapture him a few days later and haul him to a crowded garage of a medical clinic near the railroad tracks. More than a dozen other Ukrainians were jailed with him, soldiers and civilians. Two garages were for men, one for women and a bigger one \u2014 the only one with a window \u2014 for Russian soldiers.Women were held in the garage closest to the soldiers\u2019 quarters. Their screams came at night, according to Mosyakyn and Kotsar, who were both held at the clinic at different times. Ukrainian intelligence officials said they were raped regularly.For the men, Room 6 was for electrocution. Room 9 was for waterboarding, Mosyakyn said. He described how they covered his face with a cloth bag and poured water from a kettle onto him to mimic the sensation of drowning. They also hooked up his toes to electricity and shocked him with electrodes on his ears.It was here that Mosyakyn watched Russian soldiers drag out the lifeless bodies of two civilians they\u2019d tortured to death, both from Izium\u2019s Gonkharovka neighborhood.Kotsar was taken to the clinic in July and received slightly different treatment, involving a Soviet-era gas mask and electrodes on his legs. AP journalists also found gas masks at two schools.By the time Kotsar arrived, people had already been there for 12 to 16 days. They told him their arms and legs were broken, and people taken out to be shot. He vowed that if he survived, he would never allow himself to be captured again.They released him after a couple of weeks. He craved familiar faces and people who meant him no harm. He returned to the monks.\u201cWhen I came out, everything was green. It was very, very strange, because there had been absolutely no color,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything was wonderful, so vivid.\u201dIn mid-August, the bodies of three men were found in a shallow forested pit on the town\u2019s outskirts.Ivan Shabelnyk left home with a friend on March 23 to collect pine cones so the family could light the samovar and have tea. They never came back.Another man taken with them reluctantly told Shabelnyk\u2019s family about the torture they\u2019d all endured together, first in the basement of a nearby house and then in School No. 2. Then he left town.Their bodies were found in mid-August, in the last days of the occupation, by a man scavenging for firewood. He followed the smell of death to a shallow grave in the forest.Shabelnyk\u2019s hands were shot, his ribs broken, his face unrecognizable. They identified him by the jacket he wore, from the local grain factory where he worked. His grieving mother showed the AP a photo.\u201cHe kept this photo with him, of us together when he was a small boy,\u201d said Ludmila Shabelnyk, in tears. \u201cWhy did they destroy people like him? I don\u2019t understand. Why has this happened to our country?\u201dHis sister, Olha Zaparozhchenko, walked with journalists through the cemetery and looked at his grave.\u201cThey tortured civilians at will, like bullies,\u201d she said. \u201cI have only one word: genocide.\u201dThe Kharkiv region\u2019s chief prosecutor, Oleksandr Filchakov, told the AP it was too soon to determine how many people were tortured in Izium, but said it easily numbered into the dozens.\u201cEvery day, many people call us with information, people who were in the occupied territories,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day, relatives come to us and say their friends, their family, were tortured by Russian soldiers.\u201dMISSING NO MOREAfter his final escape, Kotsar hid in the monastery for more than a month. Without documents and a phone connection to prove his identity, he was too afraid to leave.Kotsar\u2019s family had no idea what happened to him. They had simply reported him missing, like so many other Ukrainian soldiers caught on the wrong side of the frontline.He spoke with effort to AP journalists, and at one point asked them to turn off the camera so he could compose himself. The AP contacted the Commissioner for Issues of Missing Persons Under Special Circumstances, which confirmed the missing person report and his identity through a photo on file. Then Kotsar\u2019s own unit, which had left Izium in disarray, returned and tracked him down.Kotsar doesn\u2019t know what comes next. Ukrainian officials are still in the process of restoring his identity documents, and without them he can\u2019t go anywhere. He would like psychological treatment to deal with the trauma from repeated torture, and for now he\u2019s staying with the monks.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for them, I probably wouldn\u2019t have survived at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThey saved me.\u201dKotsar\u2019s first call was to the sister of his best friend \u2014 the only person in his entire circle of loved ones he was certain was in a safe place. He grinned as the connection went through.\u201cTell him I\u2019m alive,\u201d he said. \u201cTell him I\u2019m alive and in one piece.\u201dRead | 'Putin cornered, might go nuclear': Ex-CIA official on Russia-Ukraine war",

    "content": "The government has put off by one month the levy of an additional Rs 2 per litre excise duty on petrol and diesel that is not doped with ethanol and bio-diesel in a bid to give the industry more time to implement the measure.The finance ministry, in a Gazette notification issued late on Friday (September 30), stated that the additional excise tax will now be levied from November 1, 2022.Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had in her Budget for the fiscal year beginning April 2022 brought a Rs 2 per litre additional levy on petrol and diesel that is not blended with ethanol and bio-diesel, respectively. This duty was to be applicable from October 1, 2022, but now has been differed to November 1.Presently, 10 per cent of ethanol, extracted from sugarcane or surplus food grain, is blended or mixed in petrol (meaning 10 per cent of ethanol mixed with 90 per cent of petrol) with a view to cutting oil import dependence and providing farmers with an additional source of income.But there is only an experimental blending of bio-diesel, extracted from non-edible oilseeds, in diesel -- the most used fuel in the country.\"Blending of fuel is a priority of this government. To encourage the efforts for blending of fuel, unblended fuel shall attract an additional differential excise duty of Rs 2 per litre from the 1st day of October 2022,\" Sitharaman had stated in her Budget speech in the Lok Sabha on February 1.In the September 30 notification, her ministry stated that \"petrol which is intended for retail sale, not so blended with ethanol or methanol\" will attract Rs 3.40 per litre basic excise duty effective November 1, 2022, instead of Rs 1.40 a litre currently.Branded petrol, not doped with ethanol, will attract Rs 4.60 a litre excise duty as against Rs 2.60 currently.In the case of diesel, it said the fuel \"intended for retail sale, not so blended with alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids obtained from vegetal oils, commonly known as bio-diesels\" shall attract Rs 3.80 a litre basic excise duty instead of Rs 1.80. Branded diesel will attract Rs 6.20 a litre basic excise levy as against Rs 4.20 currently.Besides basic excise duty, cess and special additional excise duty is levied on petrol and diesel. The total incidence of excise on petrol comes to Rs 19.90 a litre and that on diesel to Rs 15.80.While the additional duty will push oil companies to procure more ethanol for mixing in petrol and arrange for logistics for transporting to deficient areas, it is unlikely that the country will be able to build infrastructure to manufacture bio-diesel in the scale needed for blending in diesel, industry officials said.Last year, the government brought forward the target to achieve 20 per cent ethanol blending with petrol to 2025, five years ahead of its previous target, to help reduce its dependence on costly oil imports. 10 per cent ethanol blending was achieved earlier this year.India is the world's third-biggest oil importer, relying on foreign suppliers to meet more than 85 per cent of its oil demand.Read | Commercial LPG cylinder prices slashed | Check out latest rates",

    "content": "Adam Gilchrist has named Hardik Pandya in his list of top T20I players in the world today, saying that he is just an awesome player across the board.Pandya has enjoyed a great run in T20Is this year as he has produced some top performances with both bat and ball. This has earned him some high praise from many former players over the past few months.Speaking to ICC's official website, Gilchrist named the India all-rounder in his top T20I players and said that the 28-year-old is just an awesome figure across the board.\u201cPandya is just an awesome figure straight across the board,\" Gilchrist said.\u201cHis ability to bat, bowl, field and entertain, he\u2019s definitely in there.\u201dGilchrist also named David Warner, Rashid Khan, Jos Buttler and Pakistan skipper Babar Azam in his list.Former Australia all-rounder Shane Watson is also a big fan of Pandya. The India all-rounder is constantly compared with England's Ben Stokes, but Watson feels that the former is way ahead of the latter when it comes to T20 cricket.Watson also feels that Pandya is at the peak of his powers at the moment.\"Hardik is absolutely at the peak of his powers at this moment. It is an absolute treat to watch him play. I love watching fast-bowling all-rounders who steam in and have a real crack. You know, the impact they can have and they can take the game away from the opposition at any time of the game, whether it is with the bat and ball,\" said Watson.\"It is really pleasing to see Hardik playing like he is doing right now. And in regards to T20 cricket, Hardik is way above where Ben Stokes is right now. With the way Hardik is batting, his versatility while batting at the end, the way he is bowling. Right now, at this moment, Hardik is the stand-out,\" said Watson.",

    "content": "Methane escaping from the damaged Nord Stream pipelines that run between Russia and Europe is likely to result in the biggest known gas leak to take place over a short period of time and highlights the problem of large methane escapes elsewhere around the world, scientists say.\u201cFrom what I have seen this is an unprecedented loss to the atmosphere of fossil methane in a very short time from a concentrated source,\u201d said President of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences Marcia McNutt. She oversaw American government efforts to assess the breadth of the 2010 BP oil spill the gulf of Mexico.Methane acts quickly to heat the Earth. The fact that it disappears faster from the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, \u201cis probably small consolation to the citizens of Florida and other places who are already being hit by more frequent and more deadly tropical storms, supercharged by an ocean superheated by greenhouse gas releases to the atmosphere,\u201d McNutt said in an email.Also Read | Hurricane Ian: Climate change added 10% more rain, made Category-4 storm worseThere is still uncertainty in estimating total damage, but researchers say vast plumes of this potent greenhouse gas will have significant detrimental impacts on the climate.Immediate harm to marine life and fisheries in the Baltic Sea and to human health will also result because benzene and other trace chemicals are typically present in natural gas, researchers say.\u201cThis will probably be the biggest gas leak ever, in terms of its rate,\u201d said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson.The velocity of the gas erupting from four documented leaks in the pipelines \u2014 which the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has attributed to sabotage \u2014 is part of what makes the impacts severe.When methane leaks naturally leaks from vents on the ocean floor, the quantities are usually small and the gas is mostly absorbed by seawater. \u201cBut this is not a normal situation for gas release,\u201d said Jackson. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about methane bubbling up to the surface like seltzer water, but a plume of rushing gas,\u201d he said.Jackson and other scientists estimate that between 50% and nearly 100% of total methane emitted from the pipeline will reach the atmosphere.The Danish government issued a worst case scenario that assumed all the gas reached the air, and German officials Thursday issued a somewhat lower one.Also Read | Know about five oceans on Earth? The sixth has just been discoveredIn the meantime, it\u2019s nearly impossible for anyone to approach the highly flammable plume to attempt to curb the release of gas, which energy experts estimate may continue until Sunday.\u201cMethane is very flammable \u2014 if you go in there, you\u2019d have a good chance of it being a funeral pyre,\u201d said Ira Leifer, an atmospheric scientist. If the gas-air mix was within a certain range, an airplane could easily ignite travelling into the plume, for example.Methane isn\u2019t the only risk. \u201cNatural gas isn\u2019t refined to be super clean \u2014 there are trace elements of other compounds, like benzene,\u201d a carcinogen, said Leifer.\u201cThe amount of these trace elements cumulatively entering the environment is significant right now \u2014 this will cause issues for fisheries and marine ecosystems and people who potentially eat those fish,\u201d he said.David Archer, a professor in the geophysical sciences department at University of Chicago who focuses on the global carbon cycle, said that escape of methane in the Baltic Sea is part of the much larger worldwide problem of methane emissions.The gas is a major contributor to climate change, responsible for a significant share of the climate disruption people are already experiencing. That is because it is 82.5 times more potent than carbon dioxide at absorbing the sun\u2019s heat and warming the Earth, over the short term.Also Read | Nasa to raise Hubble telescope's orbit, over a decade after humans last visited itClimate scientist have found that methane emissions from the oil and gas industry are far worse than what companies are reporting, despite claims by major companies that they\u2019ve reduced their emissions.Scientists measuring methane from satellites in space have found that emissions from oil and gas operations are usually at least twice as high as what the companies reported, said Thomas Lauvaux, climate scientist at University of Reims in France.Many of those so-called leaks are not accidental. Companies release the gas during routine maintenance. Lauvaux and other scientists observed more than 1,500 major methane leaks globally, and potentially tens of thousands of smaller leaks, using satellites, he said.Also Read | Heat wave led to unprecedented melt of Swiss glaciers",

    "content": "Haiti\u2019s government on Sunday announced that at least eight people have died from cholera, raising concerns about a potentially fast-spreading scenario and reviving memories of an epidemic that killed nearly 10,000 people a decade ago.The cases - the first cholera deaths reported in three years - came in a community called Dekayet in southern Port-au-Prince and in the gang-controlled seaside slum of Cite de Soleil, where thousands of people live in cramped, unsanitary conditions.\u201cCholera is something that can spread very, very quickly,\u201d warned Laure Adrien, director general of Haiti\u2019s health ministry.Food or water contaminated with the cholera bacteria can lead to severe diarrhea and dehydration that can be deadly.The United Nations said in a statement that it is working with Haiti\u2019s government to \u201cmount an emergency response to this potential outbreak,\u201d stressing that health teams need to be guaranteed safe access to areas where cases have been reported.The deaths come as a lack of fuel and ongoing protests shut down the availability of basic services across Haiti, including medical care and clean water, which is key to helping fight cholera and keep patients alive.Haiti\u2019s most powerful gang continues to control the entrance to a main fuel terminal in the capital of Port-au-Prince, leading to a lack of fuel amid soaring prices that have unleashed widespread protests that have paralyzed the country for more than two weeks.The absence of fuel and increasing number of roadblocks have prevented water trucks from visiting neighborhoods to provide potable water to those who can afford it. It also has prompted some companies to temporarily shut down operations.On Sunday, Caribbean Bottling Company said it could no longer produce or distribute potable water because its diesel reserves were \u201ccompletely depleted,\u201d adding that the lack of such a vital resource would affect \u201call sectors of society.\u201dAdrien said health officials were trying to visit communities where cholera has been reported, but that his agency, too, has been affected by a lack of fuel as he called on people blocking the gas terminal and organizing protests to \u201chave a conscience.\u201d\u201cThis is a real problem,\u201d he said of how the country has virtually been paralyzed. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this will not spread.\u201dAdrien noted that all those who died were unable to reach a hospital in time.Haiti Health Minister Alex Larsen said people have a right to protest but asked Haitians to allow potable water supplies into neighborhoods that have been cut off by roadblocks and protests.\u201cWater has not been in these areas for a long time, and people are not drinking treated water,\u201d he said, adding that cholera cases could spike again. \u201cWe ask people who can afford it to add a little chlorine to the water.\u201dHaiti\u2019s last cholera epidemic sickened more than 850,000 people in a country of more than 11 million, marking one of the world\u2019s worst outbreaks of the preventable disease in recent history.United Nations peacekeepers from Nepal were blamed for introducing cholera into Haiti\u2019s largest river in October 2010 by sewage. The U.N. has since acknowledged it played a role in the epidemic and that is has not done enough to help fight it, but it has not specifically said it introduced the disease.Haiti would have been declared cholera-free by the World Health Organization only after reaching three consecutive years with no new cases.",

    "content": "Predictions made by scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are coming true every day. The extreme weather events are getting stronger, more frequent, and more intense, the latest is Hurricane Ian which struck Cuba, and Florida over the week.An early study of the hurricane indicates that climate change contributed significantly in worsening the situation and added 10 per cent more rain than average to the category-4 storm. The research, yet to be peer-reviewed, compared peak rainfall rates during the real storm to about 20 different computer scenarios of a model with Hurricane Ian\u2019s characteristics.The simulated hurricanes slammed into Florida with no human-caused climate change, revealing the difference in rain patterns and quantity. Michael Wehner, a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab told The Associated Press, \u201cThe real storm was 10% wetter than the storm that might have been.\"Also Read | Explained: How climate change is fueling hurricanesScientists had in the past also conducted a study looking at the hurricanes of 2020 and found during their rainiest three-hour periods they were more than 10% wetter than in a world without greenhouse gases trapping heat. The same specifications and techniques were applied to the current scenario.Also Read | How is climate change making Hurricane Ian dangerous?The situation was worsened due to the warming of the Gulf of Mexico, which was 0.8 degrees warmer than normal. Kevin Reed, an atmospheric scientist at Stony Brook University said that 10 per cent percent may not sound like a lot, but 10 per cent of 20 inches is two inches, which is a lot of rain, especially on top of the 20 inches that already fell.Other studies have seen the same feedback mechanisms of stronger storms in warmer weather, said Princeton University atmospheric scientist Gabriel Vecchi, who wasn\u2019t part of the study.Four people have died from the dangerous storm as it hit Florida after ravaging Cuba and gaining strength in the Gulf of Mexico. The hurricane barreled north on Friday toward a second landfall in South Carolina. Ian, which had weakened to a tropical storm during its march across Florida, regained Category 1 hurricane strength on Thursday afternoon while churning toward South Carolina above the Atlantic Ocean, with maximum sustained wind speeds of 120 kph.Ian came ashore on Wednesday as one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the US mainland. President Joe Biden warned Ian could prove to be the deadliest hurricane in Florida history, saying preliminary reports suggested a \"substantial\" loss of life.

An international team of scientists has now found evidence of considerable quantities of water between the Earth\u2019s upper and lower mantle.The evidence was found during the analysis of a rare diamond that formed 660 kilometers below the Earth\u2019s surface confirming the theory that ocean water accompanies subducting slabs and thus enters the transition zone. The new findings reveal that Earth's water cycle includes the Earth\u2019s interior.The study by the German-Italian-American research team has been published in the journal Nature, which states that the internal structure and dynamics of Earth have been shaped by the 660km boundary between the mantle transition zone and the lower mantle.Also Read | James Webb Telescope saw rare glow as Dart collided with asteroid | WatchThe evidence points to water in the transition zone (TZ), the boundary layer that separates the Earth\u2019s upper mantle and the lower mantle. The boundary is located at a depth of 410 to 660 kilometers, where immense pressure of up to 23,000 bar causes the olive-green mineral olivine to alter its crystalline structure.Olivine constitutes around 70 percent of the Earth\u2019s upper mantle and is also called peridot. Researchers said that at the upper boundary of the transition zone, at a depth of about 410 kilometers, it is converted into denser wadsleyite; at 520 kilometers it then metamorphoses into even denser ringwoodite.\u201cThese mineral transformations greatly hinder the movements of rock in the mantle. Subducting plates often have difficulty breaking through the entire transition zone.

Analysis of the diamond using Raman spectroscopy and FTIR spectrometry revealed ringwoodite inclusions which exhibit a high water content.The inclusions in the 1.5 centimeter diamond were large enough to allow the precise chemical composition to be determined. The team confirmed that the transition zone is not a dry sponge, but holds considerable quantities of water and likely brings us closer to \"Jules Verne\u2019s idea of an ocean inside the Earth.\"The team explains that the transition zone\u2019s high-water content has far-reaching consequences for the dynamic situation inside the Earth and if it is to be breached, it could lead to a mass movement in the crust.Also Read | Nasa to raise Hubble telescope's orbit, over a decade after humans last visited it",

    "content": "Brazil's presidential election is headed for a run-off vote, electoral authorities said on Sunday, after President Jair Bolsonaro's surprising strength in a first-round vote spoiled rival Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's hopes of winning outright.With 95% of electronic votes counted, Lula was ahead with 47.6% of votes versus 43.9% for Bolsonaro, the national electoral authority reported. As neither got a majority of support, the race will go to a second-round vote on Oct. 30.Several opinion surveys had shown Lula leading Bolsonaro by 10-15 percentage points ahead of Sunday's vote. The much tighter result dashed expectations of a quick resolution to a deeply polarized election in the world's fourth-largest democracy.Bolsonaro had questioned polls that showed him losing to Lula in the first round, saying they did not capture enthusiasm he saw on the campaign trail. He has also attacked the integrity of Brazil's electronic voting system without evidence, and suggested he might not concede if he lost.Political observers had said a wide margin of victory for Lula could sap Bolsonaro of support to challenge the electoral results. But Sunday's vote, extending a tense and violent election by another four weeks, revitalized his campaign.ALSO READ| Luiz Lula likely to win Brazil presidential election, shows poll survey\"The extreme right is very strong across Brazil,\" said Carlos Melo, a political scientist at the Insper business school. \"Lula's second-round victory is now less likely. Bolsonaro will arrive with a lot of strength for re-election.\"Some polls had suggested Lula could win over 50% of valid votes, allowing him to avoid the run-off against his fierce rival. But as results trickled in, that looked unlikely.Outside Bolsonaro's family home in Rio de Janeiro's Barra da Tijuca neighborhood, the scene of jubilant celebrations when Bolsonaro was elected in 2018, the mood was increasingly upbeat.Maria Lourdes de Noronha, 63, said only fraud could prevent a Bolsonaro victory, adding that \"we will not accept it\" if he loses. \"The polls in our country, the media, and journalists, are liars, rascals, shameless,\" she said.Although he ended his 2003-2010 government with record popularity, Lula is now loathed by many Brazilians after he was convicted of accepting bribes and jailed during the last election. His conviction was later overturned by the Supreme Court, allowing him to face his rival Bolsonaro this year, along with nine other candidates from an array of smaller parties.A career lawmaker turned self-styled outsider, Bolsonaro rode a backlash against Lula's Workers Party to victory in 2018, uniting strands of Brazil's right, from evangelical Christians to farming interests and pro-gun advocates.ALSO READ| Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro now stable, was rushed to hospital over intestinal obstructionHe has dismantled environmental and indigenous protections to the delight of commercial farmers and wildcat miners, while pushing an anti-gay and anti-abortion agenda.His popularity has suffered since the coronavirus pandemic, which he dismissed as a \"little flu.\" Corruption scandals also forced ministers out of his government and focused a harsh spotlight on his lawmaker sons.Yet Sunday's vote shows his support is far from collapsing.Lula's proposals for Brazil have been light on details, but he promises to improve the fortunes of Brazil's poor and working classes, as he did as president from 2003-2010, when he lifted millions out of poverty and burnished Brazil's global influence.While in power, Lula's approval rating soared as he expanded Brazil's social safety net amid a commodity-driven economic boom. But in the years after he left office, the economy collapsed, his hand-picked successor was impeached and many of his associates went to prison.Lula himself spent 19 months in jail for bribery convictions that were thrown out by the Supreme Court last year.ALSO READ| Brazil's leftist former president takes on rightist Bolsonaro in dramatic fight",

In its off-cycle monetary policy review in August, the RBI increased the repo rate by 50 basis points (bsp) to 5.4 per cent.Earlier in May, the RBI hiked the policy repo rate by 40 basis points or 0.40 per cent to 4.40 per cent. Then in June, the RBI further raised the rate to 4.90 per cent, a 50 basis points increase. Overall, the central bank has raised the benchmark rate by 1.90 per cent since May this year.The Consumer Price Index (CPI) based inflation, which the RBI factors in while fixing its benchmark rate, stood at 7 per cent in August. Retail inflation has been ruling above the RBI's comfort level of 6 per cent since January this year.RBI governor Shaktikanta Das retained the inflation projection at 6.7 per cent for the current fiscal while slashing the real GDP growth estimate to 7 per cent from the earlier forecast of 7.2 per cent for FY'23.The latest RBI action follows the US Federal Reserve effecting the third consecutive 0.75 percentage point interest rate increase, taking its benchmark rate to a range of 3-3.25 per cent earlier this month.(With inputs from PTI)",

    "content": "The death toll from Hurricane Ian climbed past 80 on Sunday as embattled residents in Florida and the Carolinas faced a recovery expected to cost tens of billions of dollars, and some officials faced criticism over their response to the storm.The death toll was expected to keep rising as floodwaters receded and search teams pushed farther into areas initially cut off from the outside world. Hundreds of people have been rescued as emergency workers sifted through homes and buildings inundated with water or completely washed away.At least 85 storm-related deaths have been confirmed since Ian crashed ashore Florida's Gulf Coast with catastrophic force on Wednesday as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).Florida accounted for all but four of the fatalities, with 42 tallied by the sheriff's office in coastal Lee County, which bore the brunt of the storm when it made landfall, and 39 other deaths reported by officials in four neighbouring counties.VIDEO: Aerial images show the devastating aftermath of deadly Hurricane Ian in Florida.The death toll has risen above 40, authorities said, as the southern state took stock of the aftermath of one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the United States pic.twitter.com/TPUvdbNEz7Officials in Lee County, which includes Fort Myers and Cape Coral and is on the Gulf Coast, have faced questions over whether they mandated evacuations in time.Cecil Pendergrass, chairman of the county's board of commissioners, said on Sunday that once the county was forecast to be in the cone, or the probable track of the hurricane's center, evacuation orders were given. Even then, some people chose to ride the storm out, Pendergrass said.\"I respect their choices,\" he said at a press conference. \"But I'm sure a lot of them regret it now.\"President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will see the devastation in Florida firsthand on Wednesday, the White House said in a statement on Saturday. The Bidens will visit Puerto Rico on Monday, where hundreds of thousands of people were still without power two weeks after Hurricane Fiona hit the island.Cuba is restoring power after Ian knocked out electricity to the whole country of 11 million people, flattened homes and obliterated agricultural fields.North Carolina authorities said at least four people had been killed there. No deaths were immediately reported in South Carolina, where Ian made another US landfall on Friday.Chugging over land since then, Ian has diminished into an ever-weakening post-tropical cyclone.The National Hurricane Center forecast more heavy rainfall was possible across parts of West Virginia and western Maryland into Sunday morning, and \"major to record flooding\" in central Florida.As the full scope of devastation became clearer, officials said some of the heaviest damage was inflicted by wind-driven ocean surf that raged into seaside communities and washed buildings away.Satellite images from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) showed beach cottages and a motel that lined the shores of Florida's Sanibel Island had been demolished by storm surges. Although most homes appeared to still be standing, roof damage to all was evident.Surveys from the ground showed that the barrier island, a popular tourist getaway that was home to some 6,000, was devastated.\"It's all just completely gone,\" Sanibel's city manager, Dana Souza, said. \"Our electric system is pretty much destroyed, our sewer system has been damaged badly and our public water supply is under assessment.\"The island's link to the mainland was severed by breaches to its causeway bridge, further complicating recovery efforts, Souza said.After waning to a tropical storm by the end of its march across Florida to the Atlantic, Ian regained hurricane strength and pummelled coastal South Carolina on Friday, sweeping ashore near Georgetown, north of the historic port city of Charleston.Numerous roads were flooded and blocked by fallen trees while a number of piers were damaged in that area.More than 700,000 businesses and homes remained without power on Sunday afternoon in Florida alone, where more than 2 million customers lost electricity the first night of the storm.Insurers braced for between $28 billion and $47 billion in claims from what could amount to the costliest Florida storm since Hurricane Andrew in 1992, according to US property data and analytics company CoreLogic.",

Most leading sentiment indicators are pointing toward slower growth as well.Growth eased in the second quarter across emerging markets as inflation reduced real household income, business confidence deteriorated, and the external environment became more complicated, it said.Emerging-market central banks have been ahead of their advanced-country counterparts in hiking policy rates, and in Latin America they are now near the end of their tightening cycles.Elsewhere, core inflation continues to rise, suggesting there is more work to do. Large recent hikes by the US Federal Reserve are exacerbating balance-of-payment strains across emerging markets.\"For the 16 emerging economies that we cover, excluding China, 2022 GDP growth will hit 5.2 per cent this year, in our view. This forecast is up 30 basis points from our previous round. India is the star of this group with growth of 7.3 per cent this fiscal year (ending in March 2023),\" S&P said.The US-based agency said as central banks aggressively raise rates to fight inflation, our confidence is waning that they can avoid generating a sharp downturn.\"We are now expecting a mild recession in the US,\" it said, adding that rising rates, increased European energy insecurity, and the lingering effects of Covid-19 are hitting growth almost everywhere.\"This may be the most anticipated economic slowdown on record, but the data have yet to fully fall in line,\" S&P said.",

Switzerland has the greatest volume of glaciers of any country in Europe.Also Read | How Nord Stream pipeline leak is a threat to climateMatthias Huss, a glaciologist with the Federal Polytechnic Institute in Zurich who heads the Glamos program, says there\u2019s \u201czero chance\u201d the glaciers will return for decades \u2014 at best \u2014 given current projections for global temperatures.\u201cWe have a series reaching back for more than 100 years, and we have never seen anything that is comparable to this year,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cIt\u2019s something that has been expected for the future that such extremes might come along, but now they are already here.\u201dSwitzerland faced an \u201cunlucky combination of factors\u201d this year that led to the big melt, Huss said. Snow cover in the Swiss Alps was exceptionally light, particularly in the southeast, meaning that the glaciers had less natural protection from the heat.A dust drift from the Sahara then blanketed many parts of Europe in the spring, causing the snow to absorb more solar heat. A spike in summer temperatures across Europe further intensified the glacial melt.The findings come on top of another study released last month showing that Switzerland\u2019s 1,400 glaciers have lost more than half their total volume since the early 1930s.Also Read | How is climate change making Hurricane Ian dangerous?The report issued Wednesday chronicles in detail the damage across the Swiss Alps: Over 6 meters (19.6 feet) of ice melted this year on the Konkordiaplatz summit in the Great Aletsch Glacier in the south, near the Italian border.Small glaciers like Pizol in the east near Liechtenstein, Vadret dal Corvatsch near St. Moritz in the southeast, and Schwarzbachfirn in central Switzerland have \u201cpractically disappeared,\u201d the team said.Elsewhere in Europe, the Bavarian Academy of Sciences in Germany said the ice sheet on the Southern Schneeferner in the Alps melted so much this summer that it could no longer be considered a glacier \u2014 leaving Germany now with only four glaciers.Also Read | China sounds Red Alert as biggest freshwater lake goes dryHuss said that while people are not acting quickly enough to curb global warning, he thinks the world is waking up to the threat and the need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere.\u201cThe world\u2019s leaders have at least realized that something needs to be done to prevent the negative impacts of climate change,\u201d he said. \u2019But still, I feel that not enough is actually been implemented of the plans that are around.

Scientists have proposed building a satellite that could harvest solar energy and beam it down to the planet to be used.The Space-Based Solar Power, which at the moment is theoretical, could help decarbonise the energy sector, which is largely dependent on fossil fuels and is a source of not just polluting the climate but larger geopolitical problems. The European Space Agency (ESA) said that recent studies indicate the satellite is workable.Dubbed Solaris, the satellite could be launched into the geostationary orbit, where it would harvest sunlight on a permanent 24/7 basis and then convert it into low-power density microwaves to safely beam down to receiver stations on Earth.Also Read | Asteroid that killed dinosaurs on Earth also attacked MoonESA said that there is a major technical challenge that needs to be overcome, as the physics involved in the mission would need the satellite to be at least a few kilometers long, and so should the antennas that would collect the beams from space.The challenge will be to build such high-efficiency photovoltaics, high-power electronics, and radio frequency beam systems on such a big scale. Meanwhile, the effects of low-power microwaves on human and animal health along with aircraft and satellites would also have to be studied.Also Read | This is how it looked when Dart collided with asteroid Dimorphos\u201cThese are the kind of technical questions that SOLARIS will look into, to explore further the feasibility of the concept, so that Europe could make an informed decision in 2025 on whether to proceed with a Space-Based Solar Power program in the future. As an added plus, any breakthroughs achieved in these areas will be valuable in their own right, applicable to many other spaceflight endeavours,\" Sanjay Vijendran, ESA\u2019s lead for the SOLARIS proposal, said in a statement.While countries from across the world are exploring ways to harness solar energy, in a bid to switch to renewable forms of energy. Apart from Europe, the UK has set up a Space Energy Initiative to develop Space-Based Solar Power.

    "content": "US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Sunday he sees no imminent invasion of Taiwan by China but said China was trying to establish a \"new normal\" with its military activities around the island.A visit to Taiwan early in August by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi enraged China, which subsequently launched military drills near the island. Those have continued, although on a much reduced scale.\"I don't see an imminent invasion,\" Austin said in an interview broadcast on CNN.\"What we do see is China moving to establish what we would call a new normal. Increased activity - we saw a number of center line crossings of the Taiwan Strait by their aircraft. That number has increased over time. We've seen more activity with their surface vessels and waters in and around Taiwan.\"The United States and its allies have responded to the drills by continuing to sail through the region. A U.S. Navy warship and a Canadian frigate made a routine transit through the Taiwan Strait on Sept. 20.The United States will continue to work with its allies and partners \"to ensure that we maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific,\" Austin said in an interview on CNN's \"Fareed Zakaria GPS\" that was recorded on Friday.The narrow Taiwan Strait has been a frequent source of military tension since the defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the communists, who established the People's Republic of China.The United States is working to reopen channels of military communication with China, something that is critical to both countries, Austin said.China in August halted cooperation with the United States in a number of areas, including dialogue between senior-level military commanders, in retaliation for Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.Austin said he has communicated by phone and in person with his Chinese counterpart, Defense Minister Wei Fenghe, who agreed that open communications were important.\"We'll do everything we can to continue to signal that we want those channels open and I would hope that China will begin to lean forward a bit more and work with us,\" he said.",

    "content": "Ukraine on Sunday claimed full control of the eastern logistics hub of Lyman, its most significant battlefield gain from Russia in weeks, providing a potential staging post for further attacks to the east while heaping further pressure on the Kremlin.The stinging setback for Russian President Vladimir Putin was delivered after he proclaimed the annexation of four regions covering nearly a fifth of Ukraine on Friday, an area that includes Lyman. Kyiv and the West have condemned the proclamation as an illegitimate farce.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the capture of the town, where Ukrainian flags were raised over civic buildings on Saturday, demonstrated that Ukraine is capable of dislodging Russian forces and showed the impact Ukraine's deployment of advanced Western weapons was having on the conflict.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday that the success of the country's soldiers was not limited to the recapture of Lyman.Ukraine forces have liberated the small Arkhanhelske and Myrolyubivka settlements in the Kherson region as well, he said.Ukraine's Interfax agency reported that according to Serhiy Cherevatyi, spokesman for the Ukrainian Eastern Group of Forces, Ukraine's forces recaptured Torske, a small village in the Donetsk region, about 15 kilometres (9 miles) east of the now liberated Lyman.Reuters was not able to immediately verify the reports.Russia's defence ministry said on Saturday that it was pulling troops out of the Lyman area \"in connection with the creation of a threat of encirclement\".It did not mention Lyman in its daily update on fighting in Ukraine on Sunday, although it said Russian forces had destroyed seven artillery and missile depots in the Ukrainian regions of Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv and Donetsk.Zelenskiy said the abduction of the director-general of Ukraine's Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is an act of Russian terror.A Russian patrol detained Ihor Murashov on Friday, the state-owned company in charge of the plant said on Saturday, and the International Atomic Energy Agency said Russia had confirmed the move.\"This is another instance of clear act of Russian terror, for which the terrorist state must bear an ever-increasing punishment,\" Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.The Ukrainian military said in its evening statement on Sunday that its forces had repelled Russian advances in several areas - particularly in Donetsk region near Bakhmut and Spirne, just inside Donetsk region near Lysychansk, a major centre in neighbouring Luhansk region.Russian forces had captured Lyman from Ukraine in May and had been using it as a logistics and transport hub for its operations in the north of the Donetsk region. Its recapture by Ukrainian troops is Russia's largest battlefield loss since Ukraine's lightning counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region in September.Control over Lyman could prove a \"key factor\" in helping Ukraine reclaim lost territory in the neighbouring Luhansk region, whose full capture Moscow announced in early July after weeks of grinding advances, Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai said.Lyman's operational importance was due to its command over a road crossing over the Siverskyi Donets River, behind which Russia has been attempting to consolidate its defences, Britain's Ministry of Defence said.Russia likely experienced heavy casualties during the withdrawal, the ministry added. Russia had 5,000 to 5,500 troops in the town before the Ukrainian attack, a Ukrainian military spokesman said on Saturday.The areas Putin claimed as annexed just over seven months into Russia's invasion of its neighbour - Donetsk and Luhansk plus Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south - are equal to about 18% of Ukraine's total surface land area.Russia's parliament is to consider on Monday bills and ratification treaties to absorb the regions, the speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin said.A pomp-filled Kremlin signing ceremony with the regions' Russian-installed leaders on Friday has failed to stem a wave of criticism within Russia of how its military operation is being handled. Britain's defence ministry said that was likely to intensify with further setbacks.Putin ally Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Russia's southern Chechnya region, on Saturday called for a change of strategy \"right up to the declaration of martial law in the border areas and the use of low-yield nuclear weapons.\" Washington says it would respond decisively to any use of nuclear weapons.Other hawkish Russian figures on Saturday criticised Russian generals and Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu on social media for overseeing the setbacks but stopped short of attacking Putin.The United States was \"very encouraged\" by Ukrainian gains, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Sunday, while NATO's Stoltenberg said the fall of Lyman demonstrated the effectiveness of Western weapons in the conflict.\"Allies are stepping up their support to Ukraine and that is the best way to ensure that ... Ukraine is actually able to liberate and retake occupied territory,\" Stoltenberg said in an NBC interview.U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine's presidential office, in Istanbul on Sunday and pledged Washington's steadfast support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, the White House said.Pope Francis on Sunday made an impassioned appeal to Putin to stop \"this spiral of violence and death\" in Ukraine and also called on Zelenskiy to be open to any \"serious peace proposal\".Zelenskiy said on Friday that peace talks with Russia while Putin was still president would be impossible. \"We are ready for a dialogue with Russia, but with another president of Russia,\" he said.",

Scientists have now found evidence of asteroid impacts on the Moon that coincided precisely with some of the largest meteorite impacts on Earth, including the one that killed dinosaurs.Analysis of lunar soil also unraveled that major impact events on Earth were not stand-alone events, but were accompanied by a series of smaller impacts. Scientists from Curtin University studied microscopic glass beads aged up to two billion years old that were found in lunar soil brought back to Earth.The lunar samples were brought to Earth by the Chinese spacecraft in 2020 and have been shared with the global science community for deeper analysis. Researchers said that the microscopic glass beads were created by the heat and pressure of meteorite impacts and their distribution has information about their timeline.The study published in Science Advances states that particles of silicate glass formed either during volcanic eruptions or by impact melting are a ubiquitous component of all lunar soils. Commonly referred to as beads or spherules, they range in size from a few tens of micrometers to a few millimeters and typically have spherical, oval, or dumbbell shapes.Also Read | This is how it looked when Dart collided with asteroid DimorphosScientists combined a wide range of microscopic analytical techniques, numerical modelling, and geological surveys to determine how these microscopic glass beads from the Moon were formed and when. They found that some of the age groups of the lunar glass beads coincide precisely with the ages of some of the largest terrestrial impact crater events, including the Chicxulub impact crater responsible for the dinosaur extinction event.\"The study also found that large impact events on Earth such as the Chicxulub crater 66 million years ago could have been accompanied by a number of smaller impacts. If this is correct, it suggests that the age-frequency distributions of impacts on the Moon might provide valuable information about the impacts on the Earth or inner solar system,\u201d Lead author Professor Alexander Nemchin, said in a statement.The team now wants to compare the data gleaned from these Chang\u2019e-5 samples with other lunar soils and crater ages to be able to uncover other significant Moon-wide impact events which might in turn reveal new evidence about what impacts may have affected life on Earth.Also Read | Hubble discovers unique shield that protects galaxies from being destroyed",

He urged Putin to think of his own people in the event of an escalation.One Vatican official said the impassioned address was so sombre it was reminiscent of a radio peace appeal by Pope John XXIII in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis.It was the first time Francis, who has often condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the death and destruction it has caused, had made such a direct personal appeal to Putin.Saying he was haunted by \"rivers of blood and tears that have been spilled in these months,\" Francis also called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to be open to any \"serious peace proposal\".He was making an urgent appeal \"in the name of God\" for an end to the conflict and said it was \"absurd\" that the world was risking a nuclear conflict.\"My appeal goes above all to the president of the Russian Federation, begging him to stop this spiral of violence and death, even out of love for his own people,\" Francis said.\"On the other side, pained by the enormous suffering of the Ukrainian population following the aggression it suffered, I address an equally hopeful appeal to the president of Ukraine to be open to a serious peace proposal,\" he said.Francis later tweeted both the appeals to the two leaders in Russian and Ukrainian.Speaking two days after Putin proclaimed the annexation of nearly a fifth of Ukraine and placed the regions under Russia's nuclear umbrella, Francis also emphasised all countries' right to \"sovereign and territorial integrity\".Kyiv and its Western allies have condemned Putin's annexations as illegal, and Zelenskiy has said his forces will continue their fight to recapture all Ukrainian territory occupied by Russian forces.Ukraine on Sunday claimed full control of the eastern logistics hub of Lyman, Kyiv's most significant battlefield gain in weeks.\"I strongly deplore the grave situation that has been created in the last few days, with more actions that are contrary to the principles of international law,\" he said in a clear reference to the annexation.\"This, in fact, increases the risk of an nuclear escalation to the point of fearing uncontrollable and catastrophic consequences on a global level,\" he said.In a reference to ethnic Russians living in Ukraine, Francis said it was also necessary to respect \"the rights of minorities and (their) legitimate worries\".Francis said it was \"anguishing\" that the world was learning about Ukrainian geography through names of places such as Bucha, Irpin, Mariupol, Izium, Zaporizhzhia and other places where people had suffered \"indescribable suffering and fear\".",

    "content": "Ever wondered how humans got a unique jaw that could crush complex and raw food, it all started about 400 million years ago. Researchers have unearthed fossils of four fish species that could be the first vertebrates that possessed jaws in the story of human evolution.This is the first evidence of a key period of evolution that\u2019s been hard to flesh out, because until now, scientists haven\u2019t found many fossils from that era. Vertebrates are organisms with hard skeleton and an internal backbone like humans. While two of the fish species date from 436 million years ago, two others are from 439 million years back.In a series of studies, researchers have revealed discoveries from ancient teeth to never-before-seen species. The studies indicate that life, which began in the oceans on the planet, may have started evolving teeth and jaws around the Silurian period, an important era for life on earth from 443 million years ago to 419 million years ago.Also Read | Experimental drug offers new hope for Alzheimer\u2019s patients\"The new fossils change everything. Now we know how big they are, what they look like, how they evolved over time,\" vertebrate paleontologist Min Zhu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, told Reuters. Until now, the earliest-known jawed vertebrates were fish dating to 425 million years ago.More than 20 individuals of a fish about 1.2 inches long called Xiushanosteus mirabilis were found in Chongqing municipality. It was part of a group of armored fish called placoderms that later included some real giants. They were found inside a rock, which was in perfect condition for study.Per Erik Ahlberg of Sweden\u2019s Uppsala University, an author on one of the studies told The Associated Press that the most common species in the bunch is a little boomerang-shaped fish that likely used its jaws to scoop up worms, while another fossil shows a sharklike creature with bony armor on its front \u2014 an unusual combination. A well-preserved jawless fish offers clues to how ancient fins evolved into arms and legs.Also Read | This is how it looked when Dart collided with asteroid DimorphosThe fossils from China are expected to fill in some of those gaps as researchers around the world pore over them.\"Nearly all the backboned animals or vertebrates you know - for example, those you see in zoos and aquariums, and even including ourselves - are jawed vertebrates. The basic body plan of jawed vertebrates was set up quickly after their origin. For example, we can trace almost all our organs in the human body to the first jawed fish. That's why it is important to look back, tracing the origins,\" Zhu added.Researchers found bones called tooth whorls with multiple teeth growing on them. The fossils are 14 million years older than any other teeth found from any species \u2014 and provide the earliest solid evidence of jaws to date, Zhu said.Also Read | Hubble discovers unique shield that protects galaxies from being destroyedFish first appeared roughly 520 million years ago. These earliest fish were jawless, as are modern lampreys and hagfish. At the time when the newly identified species lived, the largest marine predators were sea scorpions reaching 8 feet (2.5 meters) long.Jaws helped paved the way for fish soon to dominate the seas and later give rise to land vertebrates that branched out into amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, including humans.Also Read | 200 environmental activists killed globally in 2021: Report",

    "content": "After a two-year Covid-induced hiatus, Gandhi Jayanti celebrations returned to China's sprawling Chaoyang Park here as it resonated with the recitation of his famous quotes by Chinese school children and his bhajans by members of the Indian diaspora.Gandhi Jayanti is celebrated every year at the picturesque Chaoyang Park in Beijing ever since the statue of Gandhi, sculpted by acclaimed sculptor Yuan Xikun, was installed in 2005 on the banks of a lake amid serene surroundings to enable his admirers to pay tributes to the Mahatma.Yuan besides being an acclaimed sculptor, who sculpted the statues of famous Chinese and world leaders, is also well connected with the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) and the long-time Curator of the famous Jin Tai Art Museum located in the Chaoyang park.ALSO READ | Gandhi Jayanti 2022: History, significance, importance, wishes and quotesYuan carved out the Gandhi statue with a unique posture of the Mahatma sitting with a book in his hand.The installation of Gandhi\u2019s statue for the first time officially in Beijing was regarded as politically significant as for decades the Mahatma, a contemporary of Mao Zedong who led China\u2019s national liberation movement, has remained an enigma in China as the two leaders professed contrasting political philosophies.While Mao remained a firm advocate of violent liberation movements with his famous dictum that power flows through the barrel of the gun, Gandhi\u2019s successful non-violent movement against the British, in contrast, caught the attention of the world.Since the installation of Gandhi's statue, on every October 2 a set of Chinese school children recite his famous sayings, highlighting non-violence, adherence to truth and the importance of conservation.The practice was disrupted due to the pandemic for the past two years.ALSO READ | Gandhi Jayanti: PM Modi, President Murmu pay tributes to Mahatma Gandhi, urges people to follow Bapu's stepsThis year, over a dozen school children recited Gandhi\u2019s sayings in both Chinese and English, drawing applause at a well-attended gathering at the Jin Tai Art Museum which included Indian Ambassador Pradeep Kumar Rawat and Yuan himself.Rawat, who played a role in the installation of the statue along with Yuan during his previous diplomatic stint in Beijing in 2005, said though born in India, Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s message resonated with the entire humanity.\u201cMahatma Gandhi\u2019s principle of non-violence was all-encompassing - human against human, human against animal and more importantly human against nature,\" Rawat said.Yuan in his address said Gandhi\u2019s sculpture has also \u201cbecome a symbol of friendship between the people of India and China\u201d.\"Why do I want to create Mahatma Gandhi? Gandhi's devotion, self-restraint and self- motivation have many refractive intersections with the ancient Chinese thinkers Confucius, Mencius and Lao Zhuang,\" Yuan said.\u201cThe excellent cultural heritage he left us is the glory of the whole of mankind. He was a man of nature and used in moderation, which is the sustainable development we advocate now,\" he said.ALSO READ | From the archives: Mahatma Gandhi, a lasting LegacyThis year\u2019s highlight, however, was the short play \"Being Mahatma\" which was enacted at the museum, highlighting the handling of some of the most tense situations by Gandhiji at the height of the independence movement.Scripted and directed by T S Vivekanand, a diplomat from the Indian Embassy here, \u2018Being Mahatma\u2019 is a play which attempts to understand why Gandhi was a great soul.\"It tries to make the case that Gandhi communicated with the masses differently than others,\" Vivekanand, a poet in Tamil and English, said.He recently released an anthology of poems called \u201cCogVerse\u201d.The cast included Joji Luka, a security officer of the Indian Embassy in Beijing who acted as Gandhi, besides Rajashree Behera, first secretary and Neeru Thakkar wife of Lekhan Thakkar, Counsellor, (Economic and Commerce) of the India mission.ALSO READ | Mahatma Gandhi, Bhagat Singh are the favourite national heroes of Indian students: Survey",

    "content": "Some 200 environmental and land defense activists were killed around the world in 2021, including some 54 in Mexico, which assumed the position of the deadliest country in the annual report by nongovernmental organization Global Witness.More than three-quarters of the killings took place in Latin America, where Colombia, Brazil and Nicaragua also logged double-digit death tolls.It was the third consecutive year of increases for Mexico and a jump from 30 such activists killed in 2020.\u201cMost of these crimes happen in places that are far away from power and are inflicted on those with, in many ways, the least amount of power,\u201d the report said.Also Read | This is how it looked when Dart collided with asteroid DimorphosGlobal Witness considers its report a baseline, noting \u201cOur data on killings is likely to be an underestimate, given that many murders go unreported, particularly in rural areas and in particular countries.\u201dThe victims died fighting resource exploitation and in land disputes. Conflicts over mining were tied to 27 deaths worldwide, the most for any sector.Fifteen of those mining-related killings were in Mexico.In the western Mexico state of Jalisco, Jos\u00e9 Santos Isaac Ch\u00e1vez was killed in April 2021. He was running for local office and had made opposition to a long-running mine a central part of his campaign. Days before the election, he was found dead in his car, which had been driven off a cliff and his body showed evidence of torture. Armed men had dragged him out of his home and driven him away in his own vehicle.In April 2021, Sandra Liliana Pe\u00f1a Chocu\u00e9, an Indigenous governor in southwest Colombia, who had fought for the eradication of coca crops in Caldono, Cauca was killed near her home by armed men. Her murder was condemned by the United Nations, nongovernmental organizations and foreign governments.Overall, killings of environmental activists in Colombia dropped in 2021 to 33 from 65 the year before. The Philippines saw fewer such killings in 2021 too, 19 compared to 30 in 2020.In the Democratic Republic of Congo, all eight recorded victims were killed inside Virunga National Park.Also Read | Hubble discovers unique shield that protects galaxies from being destroyedIn November, conservation park ranger Chief Brigadier Etienne Mutazimiza Kanyaruchinya, 48, was killed when 100 heavily armed men, presumed to be former members of the M23 rebel group, attacked a patrol post near the village of Bukima in Congo\u2019s North Kivu Province.Virunga Park is home to some of the world\u2019s last mountain gorillas, but armed groups such as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, known by its French acronym FDLR, the Mai-Mai and the M23 regularly vie for control of eastern Congo\u2019s natural resources.Global Witness called on governments to enforce laws that protect activists and require informed consent from Indigenous groups, while also requiring companies to be accountable throughout their global operations and have zero tolerance for attacks on land defenders.\u201cActivists and communities play a crucial role as a first line of defense against ecological collapse, as well as being frontrunners in the campaign to prevent it,\u201d Global Witness CEO Mike Davis said in the report.Also Read | How Nord Stream pipeline leak is a threat to climate",

    "content": "Mkhaya Ntini has said that South African bowlers need to find a length and stick with it in order to restrict Suryakumar Yadav from scoring runs against them.Yadav continued his brilliant form with another fifty as he scored 61 off 22 balls to power India to a massive score and put the Proteas bowling attack to the sword.Speaking on Cricinfo, Ntini said that the South African bowlers' plan didn't come through on the day and said the only way they can restrict the in-form batter by finding a length suitable for them.He also compared the Indian and South African bowlers and said that the Proteas are bowling a length that allows Yadav time to decide on his shots.\"I'm thinking outside the box here and putting myself in those guys' shoes. I think their plan didn't come through and the only way I can restrict him from going hard on them is to find a length that is suitable for them. That I can be able to restrict him from scoring boundaries. But it didn't happen at all.\"\"It is one of those things that you buy in one mindset. Say bowl outside off stump, find a good length. Because if I compare South Africa and Indian seamers especially when it comes to the first powerplay. The length that India has bowled. It was one of those good lengths where you are not sure if you should go straightaway because the ball is still swinging. From a South African point of view, they're bowling in that seventh and eighth length that gives him more time to see where the ball is going to swing or go straight. That is one of the things I think for South African point of view, they need to identify the length that is important and they can be consistent and make sure that they don't go for runs,\" said Ntini.",

The drug lecanemab shows positive results in the phase-3 trials conducted by Alzheimer's Research UK.Being described as historic by the medical community, the drug works by removing a protein called amyloid from the brain. The organisation in a statement claimed that lecanemab \"slowed down patients\u2019 decline in memory, thinking, and improved day-to-day activities.\"'Alzheimer's affects memory, thinking, and behavior. and accounts for 60-80 per cent of dementia cases.

They were given an intravenous infusion of either lecanemab or a placebo, every two weeks. This was followed by brain scans and a regular interview-based test called CDR-SB, which measures things like memory, orientation, judgment, and problem-solving.The analysis of the trials revealed that after 18 months, the people taking the drug saw their CDR-SB score deteriorate 27% more slowly than those taking the placebo, an effect that began to be seen after six months.\"Because the trial only followed people for 18 months, it remains to be seen how patients on lecanemab will fare long term.

    "content": "The beginning of October means Nobel Prize season. Six days, six prizes, new faces from around the globe added to the world\u2019s most elite roster of scientists, writers, economists and human rights leaders.This year\u2019s Nobel season kicks off Monday with the medicine award, followed by daily announcements: physics on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The 2022 Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday and the economics award on Oct. 10.Here are five other things to know about the coveted prizes:The prizes in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace were established by the will of Alfred Nobel, a wealthy Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite. The first awards were handed out in 1901, five years after Nobel\u2019s death.Also Read | Mangalyaan quietly bids goodbye: India's maiden Mars mission runs out of fuelEach prize is worth 10 million kronor (nearly $900,000) and will be handed out with a diploma and gold medal on Dec. 10 -- the date of Nobel\u2019s death in 1896.The economics award \u2014 officially known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel \u2014 wasn\u2019t created by Nobel, but by Sweden\u2019s central bank in 1968.Between 1901 and 2021, the Nobel Prizes and the prize in economic sciences have been awarded 609 times.The Nobel statutes prohibit the judges from discussing their deliberations for 50 years. So it\u2019s probably going to be a while before we know for sure how judges made their picks for 2022 and who was on their short lists.The judges try hard to avoid dropping hints about the winners before the announcements, but sometimes word gets out. Bookies in Europe sometimes offer odds on possible peace prize and literature Nobel winners.Also Read | Syukuro Manabe, Klaus Hasselmann, Giorgio Parisi win 2021 Nobel Prize in PhysicsThousands of people around the world are eligible to submit nominations for the Nobel Prizes.They include university professors, lawmakers, previous Nobel laureates and the committee members themselves.Although the nominations are kept secret for 50 years, those who submit them sometimes announce their suggestions publicly, particularly for the Nobel Peace Prize.The Nobel Peace Prize is presented in Norway, while the other awards are handed out in Sweden. That\u2019s how Alfred Nobel wanted it.Also Read | Benjamin List, David WC MacMillan win 2021 Nobel Prize in ChemistryHis exact reasons are unclear but during his lifetime Sweden and Norway were joined in a union, which was dissolved in 1905. Sometimes relations have been tense between the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, which manages the prize money, and the fiercely independent peace prize committee in Oslo.Patience, for one.Scientists often have to wait decades to have their work recognized by the Nobel judges, who want to make sure that any breakthrough withstands the test of time.That\u2019s a departure from Nobel\u2019s will, which states that the awards should endow \u201cthose who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind.\u201d The peace prize committee is the only one that regularly rewards achievements made in the previous year.According to Nobel\u2019s wishes, that prize should go to \u201cthe person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.\u201dAlso Read | Winners of Nobel Prize 2021 in Medicine and their discovery",

    "content": "The Hubble telescope, which has been the source of unique discoveries in deep space for over three decades has revealed one more amazing feature, this time from beyond our Milky Way galaxy.The flying observatory has spotted a corona, a protective shield of hot supercharged gas, around the Magellanic system beyond the Milky Way, which protects the dwarf galaxy from being destroyed.The Large and Small Magellanic Clouds is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, where new stars are forming, and as they are pulled towards our galaxy they should have been shredded by gravity, but they remain intact. This unique feature had always puzzled astronomers as to why it remains intact despite such intense star formation activity.Also Read | When two ancient floods submerged Mars\u201cA lot of people were struggling to explain how these streams of material could be there. If this gas was removed from these galaxies, how are they still forming stars?\u201d Dhanesh Krishnarao, assistant professor at Colorado College, who led the study, said in a statement.The discovery published in Nature points to a protective shield, which prevents the gas supplies of the satellite galaxies from being siphoned off by the Milky Way, therefore allowing them to continue forming new stars.Andrew Fox of the Space Telescope Science Institute, who was co-lead on the study said, \"Galaxies envelop themselves in gaseous cocoons, which act as defensive shields against other galaxies. While the predictions of such a shield came years ago, the discovery is the first evidence of such a phenomenon in deep space.Also Read | Hurricane Ian looks furious from space as Category-3 storm hits CubaAstronomers were surprised to find that while this shield stretches nearly 100,000 light years, it is invisible, and mapping it will require scouring through 30 years of archived data for suitable measurements. They speculate that this corona is a remnant of the primordial cloud of gas that collapsed to form the galaxy billions of years ago.The team had to look through immense data gathered by the Hubble and the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) satellite archives for ultraviolet observations of quasars located billions of light-years behind it. They analysed ultraviolet light from 28 quasars to detect and characterize the material surrounding the Large Magellanic Cloud and confirm that the corona exists.\u201cAnything that tries to pass into the galaxy has to pass through this material first, so it can absorb some of that impact. In addition, the corona is the first material that can be extracted. While giving up a little bit of the corona, you're protecting the gas that's inside of the galaxy itself and able to form new stars,\u201d Krishnarao explained.Also Read | New island pops up in Pacific after underwater volcano erupts",

    "content": "Finally, the new Chief of Defence (CDS) Staff has been appointed after a delay of over nine months. India\u2019s topmost military post that was expected to usher in military reforms that were stuck in red tape ideally shouldn\u2019t have remained vacant for so long.The post was vacant since the untimely demise of General Bipin Rawat, his wife, and 12 others who died in a helicopter crash in Coonoor, Tamil Nadu on December 8, 2021.The appointment of late General Bipin Rawat was a big moment in India\u2019s military. It was a decision that shook the status quo and sent signal of the much-needed change that the Indian military needed.With General Anil Chauhan\u2019s appointment as the new CDS, another glass ceiling was broken. An officer who had hung his uniform as Lt General is back donning the olive green, but this time as a four-star officer\u2014a first among equals to the three service chiefs.As expected, there are murmurs. How can a retired Lt General be the boss of the service chiefs?Nobody really has doubts about the candidature of General Chauhan, who has held important positions, being the Director General Military Operations when the Balakot strike happened. Not many would know at the same time he was supervising Operation Sunrise, a critical military action in the northeast pushing back insurgent groups on the Myanmar border, specifically in Mizoram. This was followed by him being the Eastern Army Commander, overseeing operations along the Line of Actual Control in Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim and the northeast.The concerns about his candidature are not about metro but about hierarchical protocols.There could be questions raised about the top military position turning into a post-retirement job, but that\u2019s about all. For matters of academic debate and analysis, that\u2019s fine but the unprecedented move is once again in sync with the vision for having a CDS.So, frankly, there is nothing wrong with it. It\u2019s a progressive step with the right messaging, just the kind needed for reforms in the military.The government had earlier made changes for eligibility criteria, creating a wider pool of officers available for selection as CDS.All serving and retired three-star officers\u2014Lt Gen in the army, Air Marshal in the Air Force and Vice Admiral in the Navy, can be picked up. But there was a caveat; a retired officer who has turned 62 cannot be given the job.So, the choice had to be made from either the current three service chiefs, all serving three-star officers, or a retired three-star officer less than 62 years.With a retired officer who did not become chief or a four-star officer as in the case of General Chauhan, this is a big step. It could even be a radical change from the past.In this context, it's ironic that the appointment of the new CDS coincides with another big change being planned in the Indian Army.Shedding its colonial legacy and be a true desi fauj or an indigenised army if one can say so.So, coming to the point of juxtaposing the two subjects\u2014a retired officer as CDS and the army getting rid of the colonial legacy.The CDS\u2019s appointment is a change from the past aimed at making India\u2019s military more efficient, by enhancing operational capabilities, bringing in reforms like theatreisation, speeding up the procurement procedures and much more.The CDS also heads the newly carved Department of Military Affairs (DMA) being its secretary. This was conceptualised with an aim to strike more synergy within the armed forces but also to integrate the Ministry of Defence and the three forces and being a single-point military advisor to the government.Not just this, the CDS has financial powers and plays a key role in promoting synergy in procurement, training and staffing for the services through joint planning and integration of their requirements.On the other hand, the need to get rid of colonial past is merely symbolic. Rather, it could have a bearing on the army's functioning.Every now and then this subject comes up. Why should the Indian armed forces continue to cling on to the culture imposed by our colonial masters?But now the Indian Army has started a review to get rid of British legacies. It has been stated that the Indian Army\u2019s practices and legacies should be aligned to the national sentiment.Nobody can deny that the armed forces have followed a template set by the British and that it has had a massive bearing on not just the operational ethos but to an extent, it has influenced the culture of our military as well. But that doesn\u2019t mean the Indian armed forces don\u2019t have their own identity.Even troops, part of the two World Wars, fought with their Indian identity. It\u2019s always been the British Indian Army.There is a long list of officers, men of honour part of military action and strategy in post-independent India that were commissioned into the British Indian Army.The gallantry awards given have been Indian, not British honours.It\u2019s wrong to assume the Indian Army still works in a colonial hangover.Are we saying in these years the Indian Army has not been indigenized?Nothing wrong with doing away with small changes, but if a big shake-up leads to tinkering with the way the army functions, it won\u2019t be the best idea.The subject has always been a debatable one within the serving as well as the retired community. If there are doubts, it\u2019s better not to change the status quo.Apart from the \u2018British\u2019 influence that we see in the everyday culture of the armed forces the biggest impact on the functioning of the Indian Army is the regimental system. It\u2019s true that the British picked up soldiers from certain regions as a policy of divide and rule and to ensure troops coming from the same region and cultural backgrounds fight for each other and the honour of their clans.Regions and communities seen as a threat or rebelling were not included.The regimental system, by default, has become a pillar for the Indian Army. Not just in terms of operational ethos, but giving the Indian Army a unique identity. India\u2019s diversity is appropriately reflected in the ethos of these regiments of the Indian Army.It's in this context the changes to India's military should be more operational oriented and not about the past. After all there is lot be learnt from history, deleting it would be counterproductive.",

    "content": "A stampede at a soccer stadium in Indonesia has killed at least 125 people and injured more than 320 after police sought to quell violence on the pitch, authorities said on Sunday, in one of the world's worst stadium disasters.Officers fired tear gas in an attempt to disperse agitated supporters of the losing home side who had invaded the pitch after the final whistle in Malang, East Java, on Saturday night, the region's police chief Nico Afinta told reporters.\"It had gotten anarchic. They started attacking officers, they damaged cars,\" Nico said, adding that the crush occurred when fans fled for an exit gate.Some local officials had put the death toll at 174, but East Java Deputy Governor Emil Dardak said the number of fatalities had subsequently been revised down to 125.The earlier figure may have included duplicate fatalities, he said.An East Java police spokesperson said 323 people were injured, up from the initial count of 180.The stadium disaster appeared to be the world's worst in decades.Video footage from local news channels showed fans streaming onto the pitch after Arema FC lost 3-2 to Persebaya Surabaya around 10 p.m. (1500 GMT), followed by scuffles, and what appeared to be clouds of tear gas and unconscious fans being carried out of the venue.Many victims at the nearby Kanjuruhan hospital suffered from trauma, shortness of breath and a lack of oxygen due to a large number of people at the scene affected by tear gas, said hospital head Bobi Prabowo.Bobi told Metro TV that some victims had sustained brain injuries and that the fatalities included a 5-year-old.President Joko Widodo said authorities must thoroughly evaluate security at matches, adding that he hoped this would be \"the last soccer tragedy in the nation\".Jokowi, as the president is known, ordered the Football Association of Indonesia, PSSI, to suspend all games in the top league, BRI Liga 1, until an investigation had been completed.World soccer's governing body FIFA specifies in its safety regulations that no firearms or \"crowd control gas\" should be carried or used by stewards or police.East Java police did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether they were aware of such regulations.FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a statement to Reuters that the football world was in \"a state of shockfollowing the tragic incidents that have taken place in Indonesia\" and the event was a \"dark day for all involved\".FIFA has requested a report on the incident from PSSI, which has sent a team to Malang to investigate, PSSI secretary general Yunus Nusi told reporters.Indonesia's human rights commission also plans to investigate security at the ground, including the use of tear gas, its commissioner told Reuters.\"Many of our friends lost their lives because of the officers who dehumanised us,\" said Muhammad Rian Dwicahyono, 22, crying as he nursed a broken arm at the local Kanjuruhan hospital. \"Many lives have been wasted.\"On Sunday, mourners gathered outside the gates of the stadium to lay flowers for the victims.Amnesty International Indonesia slammed the security measures, saying the \"use of excessive force by the state ... to contain or control such crowds cannot be justified at all\".The country's chief security minister, Mahfud MD, said in an Instagram post that the stadium had been filled beyond its capacity. Some 42,000 tickets had been issued for a stadium designed to hold 38,000 people, he said.Financial aid would be given to the injured and the families of victims, East Java Governor Khofifah Indar Parawansa told reporters.There have been outbreaks of trouble at matches in Indonesia before, with strong rivalries between clubs sometimes leading to violence among supporters.Crowds pack stadiums but the football scene in Indonesia, a country of 275 million people, has been blighted by hooliganism, heavy-handed policing and mismanagement.Zainudin Amali, Indonesia's sports minister, told KompasTV the ministry would re-evaluate safety at football matches, including considering not allowing spectators in stadiums.Periodic stadium disasters have horrified fans around the world. In 1964, 328 people were killed in a crush when Peru hosted Argentine at the Estadio Nacional.In a 1989 British disaster, 96 Liverpool supporters were crushed to death when an overcrowded and fenced-in enclosure collapsed at the Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield.Indonesia is scheduled to host the FIFA under-20 World Cup in May and June next year. They are also one of three countries bidding to stage next year's Asian Cup, the continent's equivalent of the Euros, after China pulled out as hosts.The head of the Asian Football Confederation, Shaikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, said in a statement he was \"deeply shocked and saddened to hear such tragic news coming out of football-loving Indonesia\", expressing condolences to the victims, their families and friends.",

    "content": "Europe and Russia are once again at the point of a face-off with leaks in the Nord Stream gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea emerging as the new flashpoint. Europe has said that the leaks are a 'deliberate act' aimed at exacerbating a looming energy crisis that has been a result of Russia's invasion of neigbouring Ukraine.This week, three separate ruptures were reported to have impacted the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines following suspected explosions in the Baltic sea. The pipelines are meant to carry natural gas from Russia to Europe. While the pipelines were not in full operation (due the Russia-Ukraine war) at the time of the ruptures and the resultant leaks, they still contained natural gas.While the Nord Stream leaks -- deliberate or not -- have been linked to the Russia-Ukraine war and Europe's dependency on Russian oil, larger questions are being raised about the damage that could be caused by the methane spewing from the undersea pipelines to the climate.The natural gas transported through the Nord Stream pipeline is mostly composed of methane, which is the second most powerful greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. While scientists are certain that the climate calamity is a major consequence of such leaks, they are yet to quantify the extent of climate damage the current leaks are likely to cause.David McCabe, a senior scientist at the non-profit Clean Air Task Force, told Reuters that if these pipelines fail, the impact on the climate would be disastrous and could even be unprecedented. Scientists have maintained that it is not yet possible to assess the size of the leak, given the uncertainties around factors such as the temperature of the gas in the pipeline, how fast it's leaking, and how much gas would be absorbed by microbes in the water.While experts suggest that the leak could continue for days and even weeks before being fixed, experts worry as the largest of the gas leaks has caused surface disturbances of well over a kilometre in diameter. Meanwhile, vessels are also expected to lose buoyancy if they enter the area, and there might be a risk of leaked gas igniting over the water and in the air.When it comes to the marine life in and around the leaks, experts believe that it poses little risk and there is no significant threat to marine life. However, Greenpeace raised concerns on Tuesday that fish may get caught in plumes of gas, and their breathing could be damaged.Reports indicate that the leaks together were releasing more than 500 metric tons of methane per hour when first breached, with the pressure and flow rate decreasing over time. Officials have said that the Nord Stream 2 - one of the leaking pipelines, which never started operating had 300 million cubic meters of gas.If the entire stock of natural gas escapes into the environment, it will result in around 200,000 tonnes of methane emissions. Experts estimate that such an amount will have about the same global warming potential over a 100-year timeframe as about 6 million tons of carbon dioxide.",

    "content": "The UN report listing \u201cvictims of enforced disappearances\u201d in Bangladesh is replete with inaccuracies, with the leading academics and right activists raising questions over the shoddy job. The fact that two separatist insurgents, both back in India, figured in the UN list says a lot about the report.Dismayed over such \u201csloppy\u201d work, experts in Bangladesh have raised questions over the global body\u2019s over-reliance on some local non-government organisations (NGOs), who are close to or even run by the Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) workers. The BNP, for its part, has a blatant record of faking cases of human rights as validated through media reports and accounts from the country\u2019s known rights activists.Bangladesh's best known rights activist and lawyer Sultana Kamal said in an interview that the \u201cBNP has a history of faking cases of human rights\u201d, and called for \u201clegal action against the party\u201d.\u201cThe fake human rights abuse cases by the BNP has already damaged their image significantly\u201d, said Sultana Kamal in an interview with India Today.Meanwhile, the sensational case of the re-appearance of an aged woman, Rahima Begum, has also raised doubts about the UN report. Rahima Begum went into hiding on August 27 and was later found by police on September 24. This case brings into question the authenticity of claims about enforced disappearances made by some Bangladesh rights groups whose findings seem to influence the UN Working Group's report and the action of some foreign governments.Moriom Mannan, daughter of Rahima, first identified the picture of a dead body as that of her mother before the media. When Moriom was contacted by the police, she again identified her as her mother.\"The whole concept of evidence seeking has been opened to question,\" said a lawyer, Shahnaz Parvin Dolly.ALSO READ | Sheikh Hasina: The steady hands steering South Asia\u2019s youngest nation amidst global turbulenceProfessor Imtiaz Ahmed, who teaches international relations at Dhaka University, says the fake disappearance cases actually tend to discredit the entire rights issue scenario in Bangladesh.\"After including fake cases in their list, the entire UN report is called into question. And the groups who are responsible are actually damaging the cause of human rights in Bangladesh, \"Prof Imtiaz Ahmed said in an interview with the country\u2019s leading outlet Somoy TV.However, Imtiaz Ahmed, who once headed the Centre for Genocide Studies at Dhaka University, strongly pitched for strict action on enforced disappearances and said such cases should be brought down to zero.Now a careful look at the UN list has further pointed out many more glaring errors.The most startling instance smacking of double standards is the inclusion of sacked military official Hasinur Rahman in the UN list.Hasinur was found to violate his Army service conduct rules by staying in touch with outlawed radical outfits like Hizbut Tahrir, according to media reports published back in 2012. The Hizbut Tahrir deems all westerners as 'Murtad' (apostate), staunchly advocates introduction of Sharia, like in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, and seeks to end education rights for girls, something that Bengali women who make up half the country's population are opposed to.Hasinur was court-martialled, but is now happily attending talk-shows online, advocating for the BNP.PM Sheikh Hasina, ever since she returned to power in Jan 2009, has prioritised insulating the Bangladesh Army from radical influences or political influence. PM Sheikh Hasina\u2019s efforts have paid off, as is evident from the increasing role of the Bangladesh Army in UN Peacekeeping operations.Inclusion of cases of disappearances that took place long before the Awami League came to power has also raised questions over the intent of the list, especially because this UN Report on 'Enforced Disappearances ' seems to be a key document used by the US when it decided to issue sanctions against seven officers of the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), including outgoing police chief Benazir Ahmed.Kalpana Chakma, an activist in Chittagong Hill Tracts, went missing in June, 1996, days before the Awami League was voted back to power. According to reports, on 12 June 1996, at 1 am, a few hours before the general elections, six or seven army men in plainclothes forced their way into Kalpana's house and abducted her.Barisal Chhatra League's former cultural secretary, Mohammad Shafiqullah Monayem, went missing on December 1, 2007, long before the Awami League came to power. He disappeared when the country was ruled by a military-backed caretaker system that reportedly enjoyed support from western countries. In fact, Shafik happened to be a leader of the Awami League-backed student front.On May 25, 2008, Md Hasan Khan, who went missing during the same tenure of the army-backed caretaker government, also featured on the list.\u201cOf course, the current government needs to find out the whereabouts of those that went missing under previous regimes, but without mounting equal pressure on those very regimes responsible for such disappearances leaves a big question mark over the intention of such a group,\u201d said a Bangladeshi advocate.According to Bangladeshi media, at least 10 of those in the UN group's list of 76 enforced disappearances were staying with their families in Bangladesh. But there are at least 28 names on the UN list that have criminal charges against them.One person who was shown as \u201cdisappeared\u201d was found to have embarked on \u201ca solitary mission seeking divine blessings from some shrines\". Moreover, some of those on the UN list are not any innocent dissenters picked up by law enforcement agencies, but those who are absconding because they are wanted by the police in connection with serious crimes like murder and arson.Another BNP activist, accused of fire-bombing public vehicles, has been absconding since February 2015 to evade the police dragnet. Between 2013 and 2015, the BNP and the Jamaat e Islami cadres firebombed hundreds of public vehicles, leading to dozens of deaths and severe burn injuries, according to national and international outlets. The police registered cases against those accused and most of them absconded to evade arrest.Interestingly, another person who has been charged in several cases, like narcotics trafficking, arson and murder, is also listed in the UN Working Group report on 'Enforced Disappearances '. But according to sources, he has been staying in his home now after getting bail from the courts.\"To list all these absconders accused of serious crimes as victims of enforced disappearances is a travesty of justice. That the UN Working Group has bought into the preposterous narrative of some local NGOs like Odhikar is shameful,\" said the advocate.\"There are hundreds of absconders evading justice in the US or any other country. Can we dub them as victims of enforced disappearances? If that is not possible in the US, how does it become possible in Bangladesh?\" she questioned.\"If you start listing absconders fleeing justice as victims and deliberately overlook grave crimes they have committed, are you helping the cause of justice? The answer is an empathic no,\" she added.The list containing 76 persons handed over by the United Nations\u2019 Human Rights Council\u2019s Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances bears striking resemblance to similar lists first floated by local NGOs like Odhikar and then recycled by US-based Human Rights Watch and UK-based Amnesty International.The UN Report seems to have bought into these lists, overlooking grave factual errors.In an interview with Shomoy TV, Professor Imtiaz Ahmed said, \"How can an UN group just blindly accept the reports of biased local organisations which are headed by known opposition elements?\"Odhikar is headed by Adilur Rahman Khan Shuvro, a former deputy attorney general during the 2001-2006 BNP-JAMAAT government.Recently, the organisation lost its license for non compliance with government regulations. Back in 2013, when law enforcers flushed out Hefazat-e-Islam rioters who ran amok in the capital, Odhikar came out with a fact-finding report, \u201cAssembly of Hefazat-e Islam Bangladesh and Human Rights Violation\u201d.It was a composition of half-truths, biased and one-sided presentation of what happened on May 5 and in the early hours of May 6 in the capital, according to an analysis by a leading Bangladesh daily.Replete with imaginary death figures, the report drew flak from all the leading national outlets, while one daily termed it as \u201cfilled with imaginary figures\u201d. Notably, some of those who were cited as \u201cmissing activists\u201d were found giving quotes to the media. The inaccuracies did not end there. The report altered the geography of the nation as independent investigations found no village called Nimai Kachari in Bagmara where Odhikar claimed to have found \u201cdead people\u201d.\u201cIt is not wise or proper for any responsible organisation, let alone the UN to rely completely on the list provided by any organisation without verifying the contents with credible sources, particularly in terms of numbers and veracity of the cases, otherwise it undermines the gravity of the issue\u201d, observed longtime rights activist, Sultana Kamal.However, she also sounded caution, \u201cIt must also be kept in mind that mistake in the number or figures in a list do not automatically dismiss the issues in question or does not mean the complaints are totally wrong.\u201dSultana Kamal also blamed some Western rights bodies for double standards, saying they opposed the 1971 war crimes trials when it was necessary to try perpetrators of the Liberation War genocide.\u201cThe Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International's role regarding the trial of the war criminals was not fair. Also them not being vocal against war crimes committed in 1971 and not supporting Bangladesh's demand for global recognition of the genocide is no doubt disappointing,\" Sultana Kamal told India Today.Titled as \u201cSorry Khaleda\u201d, one of Bangladesh\u2019s leading media outlets earlier exposed how BNP leaders, including its chief Begum Zia, attempted to mislead the country with exaggerated figures of what it called \u201cmissing activists and leaders\u201d.Independent media reports investigated the high death figures in nine districts presented by the BNP chief Khaleda Zia and found them incorrect, exaggerated, and false.Khaleda, on February 4, 2014, had claimed that law enforcers and Awami League men had killed 242 BNP-led alliance men in 34 districts across the country. She, however, gave the names of only five of the victims (two cases of killing and three of forced disappearance).Upon cross-checking with local BNP leaders in the nine districts, newspapers found that there had been only 17 deaths during the period, as against 152 claimed by Khaleda.ALSO READ | On Sheikh Hasina\u2019s birthday, greetings from a fellow Bengali, and an appeal",

The Artemis-1 rocket has been moved into the safety of the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB), where it will remain until the next launch opportunity.The world's most powerful rocket, aimed at returning humans to the Moon, had been on the launchpad for over a month, during which Nasa tried to launch it twice. The launch attempts were, however, scrubbed due to engine issues followed by repeated hydrogen leaks in the booster.The spacecraft moved into VAB, covering a four-mile journey from Launch Pad 39B, after Nasa decided to forego the third launch attempt set for September 27, followed by a backup launch opportunity on October 2.

    "content": "A number of scientists have wondered if aluminum, a vaccine additive that has been used for decades, had a role in allergies and asthma in children.A new federally funded study has found a possible link, but experts say the research has important shortcomings and is not a reason to change current vaccine recommendations. The study doesn\u2019t claim aluminum causes the breathing condition, and officials say more work is needed to try to confirm any connection, which hadn\u2019t been seen in earlier research.Even if a link were ever found, the life-saving benefits of the vaccines are still likely to outweigh the asthma risk, said Dr. Matthew Daley, the study\u2019s lead author. But it\u2019s possible that if the results are confirmed, it could prompt new work to redesign vaccines, he added.Dr. Paul Offit, of Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, worried that the flawed study will needlessly scare some families away from proven vaccines.\u201cMaking an extraordinary claim requires extraordinary evidence,\u201d Offit said. This study does not offer that kind of evidence, he said.He and other outside experts noted that Daley and his colleagues were unable to account for the effects of some potentially important ways children are exposed to aluminum \u2014 such as in the air or through their diet.They also noted the findings include hard-to-explain inconsistencies, like why, in one subset of thousands of fully vaccinated kids, more aluminum exposure didn\u2019t seem to result in a higher asthma risk.CDC officials, in a statement, said it appears that aluminum-containing vaccines \u201cdo not account for the overall trends that we see.\u201dThe study, released Tuesday, suggests that young children who were vaccinated with most or all of the recommended aluminum-containing vaccines had at least a 36% higher risk of being diagnosed with persistent asthma than kids who got fewer vaccines.Aluminum has been used in some vaccines since the 1930s, as an ingredient \u2014 called an adjuvant \u2014 that provokes stronger immune protection.By age 2, children should be vaccinated against 15 diseases, according to U.S. recommendations. Aluminum adjuvants are in vaccines for seven of them.Aluminum adjuvants have long been considered safe and effective. Still, scientists noted a period of increased rates in allergies and asthma among U.S. children during a 30-year period starting in about 1980, and some wondered if there was a connection. (Those rates leveled off starting about a decade ago and have declined somewhat in recent years, for reasons not fully understood.)Several previous studies didn\u2019t find a link between aluminum-containing childhood vaccines and allergies and asthma. But other research has linked aluminum in industrial workplaces to asthma. And mice injected with aluminum suffer an immune system reaction that causes the kind of airway inflammation seen in childhood asthma.\u201cBased on what I consider limited animal data, there is a theoretical risk that the aluminum in vaccines could influence allergy risk,\u201d said Daley, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.In 2013, the Institute of Medicine \u2014 now known as the National Academy of Medicine \u2014 called for more federal research into the safety of childhood vaccines, including their use of aluminum.The new study is part of the government response to that call, Daley said. It was funded by the CDC, and included current and former CDC staffers among its authors. It was published by the medical journal Academic Pediatrics.The researchers focused on about 327,000 U.S. children born from 2008 to 2014, looking at whether they got vaccines containing aluminum before age 2 and whether they developed persistent asthma between ages 2 and 5.Asthma, a condition that can cause spasms in the lungs, usually results from an allergic reaction. About 4% of U.S. children under 5 have persistent asthma.The researchers took steps to try to account for different factors that might influence the results, including race and ethnicity, whether kids were born premature or whether children had food allergies or certain other conditions.But there were many other factors they were unable to address. For example, aluminum can routinely be found in breastmilk, infant formula and food, but the researchers were unable to get data on how much aluminum the kids got from eating. They also had no information on aluminum exposures from the air and environment where the children lived.The researchers split the study group into two. One was about 14,000 kids who developed eczema, a skin condition that is seen as an early indicator for the development of asthma or other allergic diseases. They wanted to see if kids with eczema were more or less sensitive to aluminum in vaccines, compared with children who did not have early eczema. The other 312,000 or so kids in the study did not have early eczema.Both groups got roughly the same amount of vaccine-related aluminum. The researchers found that for each milligram of aluminum received through vaccines, the risk of persistent asthma rose 26% in the eczema kids and 19% in kids who did not have eczema.Overall, kids who got 3 milligrams or more of vaccine-related aluminum had at least a 36% higher risk of developing persistent asthma than kids who got less than 3, Daley said.Offit said the study\u2019s limitations meant that the work has \u201cadded nothing to our understanding of vaccines and asthma.\u201dBut other experts said the researchers drew from a respected set of patient data and worked carefully with the best information that was available.\u201cThis is public health at its best. They are making every effort to find any possible signal that may be a concern,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota\u2019s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to exhaustively examine that to see if that\u2019s true.\u201dHe acknowledged anti-vaccine activists will likely jump to conclusions that the evidence doesn\u2019t support. But if CDC had the information and didn\u2019t publish it, the agency might be seen as misleading the public, further eroding trust, he said.Dr. Sarah Long, professor of pediatrics at the Drexel University College of Medicine, echoed that.\u201cI believe in complete transparency,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve asked a question and here spent our (taxpayer) money to (investigate) that question, I think the results should be aired in all of its warts and glory.\u201d",

    "content": "As Earth gets warmer, scientific predictions are getting more accurate by the day. With climate change raging across the world, extreme weather events are being fueled with new energy and the same is happening with Hurricane Ian, which is battering Cuba while on its way to Florida.The Category-3 storm not only gained wind speed but also strength within a day as seen in several other Atlantic storms in the recent past. The hurricane is expected to become a Category-4 storm as it moved ahead towards the coast of Florida through the Gulf of Mexico.But why is it getting so ferocious and that too so quickly? The answer to that question is global warming.The hurricane is being turbocharged by warm waters that it has found in the Caribbean. The storm became 67 per cent stronger in less than 22 hours from Monday to Tuesday and is bearing down as a likely Category 4 hurricane that threatens to deliver hellish storm surges.Also Read | Hurricane Ian looks furious from space as Category-3 storm hits CubaThe hurricane came across warm water in the Caribbean, which is about 1 degree warmer than normal seawater. This temperature rise in the Caribbean is attributed to climate change, which acts like a fuel triggering the storm. Meanwhile, the accumulation of heat-trapping gases from emissions and fossil fuels adds to the wound as it makes storms slower and wetter.The greenhouse gases are responsible for triggering deadly storm surges through sea-level rise, worsening freshwater flooding, and increasing the proportion of monster Category 4 and 5 storms. According to experts, the current hurricane season had been uncharacteristically mild until about a week ago because of dry air in the Atlantic.More powerful hurricanes hold more moisture, which makes them more explosive in the form of torrential rains and storm surges, experts say.Analysis of data from the National Hurricane Center reveals that while hurricane seasons fluctuate year-to-year when looked at over 10-year intervals, there are roughly 25 per cent more rapidly intensifying storms in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific now than 40 years ago, the Associated Press reported.Also Read | New island pops up in Pacific after underwater volcano eruptsMeanwhile, a yet-to-be peer-reviewed study reveals that hurricanes near the coast -- a dangerous point for people -- storms are intensifying more quickly than ever before. \u201cIt\u2019s more likely because of climate change,\" Karthik Balaguru, a Pacific Northwest National Lab climate scientist told AP.The Hurricane is expected to get even stronger as it comes across the warm Gulf of Mexico, with wind speeds expected to hit over 210 kilometers per hour. Ian hit a Cuba that has been struggling with an economic crisis and has faced frequent power outages in recent months.It made landfall as a Category 3 storm on the island\u2019s western end, devastating Pinar del R\u00edo province, where much of the tobacco used for Cuba\u2019s iconic cigars is grown.Also Read | When two ancient floods submerged Mars",

    "content": "Chinese President Xi Jinping has said that the Communist Party must be united to prepare for \u201cgreat struggles and face major risks\u201d, ahead of this month\u2019s key Congress of the ruling party where he is expected to get endorsed for a record third five-year term unlike his predecessors.In an article published in the party's journal Qiushi on Saturday, China\u2019s National Day, 69-year-old Xi said the country \u201chas never been closer\u201d to achieving its great national rejuvenation, but the last mile would be full of perils and challenges.\u201cOur party must be united to lead the people to face major challenges effectively, defend against major risks, overcome major barriers and resolve major contradictions. We must press on with great struggles under new historical characteristics,\u201d Xi wrote, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on Sunday. He, however, did not elaborate.His comments exhorting the 96-million-member strong Communist Party of China (CPC) came as it is set to hold the once-in-a-five-year Congress on October 16 here which would discuss the new political and economic policy frameworks for the future and also endorse Xi for a new five-year term in power or perhaps for life.If endorsed, Xi will become the only leader after the party's founder Mao Zedong to continue in power beyond the stipulated 10-year term. Xi will be completing the 10-year term this year.His call for the party's unity came as China under his leadership faced increasing isolation with growing adversity with the US, EU and Japan over Taiwan besides growing domestic pressures owing to economic slowdown exasperated by his zero COVID policy forcing lockdowns of various cities over recurring spikes of the virus.Xi said that the party members must demonstrate tenacity and persistence to complete the journey.This required the party to stay focused and have conviction in the path it had taken, he added.\u201cWe will not walk back to the old path of isolation and dogmatism, nor shall we ever take the evil path of changing flags,\u201d he said, using a metaphor common in revolutionary language to mean changing the political system.Ahead of the Congress, a number of high-level security officials who were reportedly part of a \u201cpolitical clique\u201d against Xi were either indicted or sentenced to death on charges of corruption and misuse of power.Since he came to power in 2012, Xi has carried out an anti-corruption campaign in which over a million officials, including dozens of top military officers, were punished.Critics of Xi say the anti-graft campaign which is still continuing has enabled him to consolidate his hold on the party and the military.The CPC holds a Congress every five years. But this year's Congress is regarded as significant, as it is a leadership change year for the century-old party.On Friday, Premier Li Keqiang, in a speech to the annual National Day gala, urged local governments not to stand by idly but take immediate action to stabilise the economy.Stating that time waits for no man Li, currently, the number two leader after Xi, urged officials to focus all their efforts to improve the economy.\u201cOur economy right now is facing many challenges and difficulties. Time waits for no man. We must focus all efforts on implementing measures to stabilise the economy. We still have the confidence and ability to keep our economic growth within the accepted range,\u201d Li, who will step down after the Congress, said.",

The middle-order struggled after the wickets of Babar Azam and Mohammed Rizwan and Akhtar is concerned about the team heading into the T20 World Cup.Speaking on his YouTube channel, the former pacer said that the middle-order isn't good and they fail when the openers don't perform well. He went on to say that he hopes the team doesn't crash out in the group stages and went on to say that Pakistan is in a dire situation at the moment.Akhtar did have some praise reserved for Haris Rauf and urged the other bowlers to step up as well.Pakistan middle-order is not good. If the openers don't perform, the middle-order collapses. This is not the way you go into the World Cup and win the World Cup. It will not work this way.Even in terms of the World Cup, I hope Pakistan don't crash out in the first round. I'm scared with this team. That is why I criticized Saqlain and others to get your middle-order, batting order in order. Somehow they're not listening. But hopefully, Pakistan make a good comeback in the World Cup and in New Zealand tri-series. I like to see Pakistan doing well and it is disheartening to see them lose. But Pakistan is in a dire situation and from here things aren't going to be easy for them. Hopefully they will learn a thing or two from my videos and improve their middle order. Babar cannot perform in every game.But well done Haris Rauf. You have done wonders with the T20 cricket and I want other bowlers to step up and making sure they take some wickets.",

In a study published in Nature, Chinese scientists revealed new findings from the smooth plains of the volcanic and sedimentary surfaced regions.The rover, which is in the large plain area within the largest known impact basin in the solar system, is the core component of the Tianwen-1 mission.

The rover has been exploring the southern part of Utopia Planitia, which was also the landing site for Nasa's Viking-2 mission.The region was chosen to land the rover as it is believed to once have been the location of a vast ocean and repeated floodings due to the presence of sedimentary rocks.

However, they maintained that while no direct evidence for the existence of liquid water was found within the radar detection depth range, \"they cannot rule out the presence of saline ice in the subsurface of the landing area.\"Apart from Zhurong, Nasa's Perseverance rover is also exploring the surface of Mars, looking for evidence of ancient microbial life.Also Read | For our dinosaurs: Earth strikes back as Dart bangs asteroid in epic mission",

Net migration to Britain totalled 239,000 in the year to June 2021, according to the most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics.Braverman also said she wanted to restrict the ability of migrants to challenge deportation on the basis that they had been subjected to forced labour or human trafficking, known in Britain as \"modern slavery\".",

Eleven hours after the eruption, a new island stood above the water surface.The Operational Land Imager-2 (OLI-2) on the Landsat 9 satellite has picked up the eruption and the new island, which now sits above the surface of the water. The new island and the eruption came months after the massive explosion of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano that shot up ash and gases nearly 1,28,000 feet in the air, lasting for about 10 minutes.The new island is located southwest of Late Island, northeast of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha\u2018apai, and northwest of Mo\u2018unga\u2018one.Also Read | Galaxy just bigger than Milky Way looks ghostly in Webb's latest picturesThe satellite captured the new island and the volcano spewing gases a few days later as plumes of discolored water circulated nearby.

    "content": "A country with one of the highest rates of crimes against women is now worshipping different forms of a goddess for nine days. At the end of the Navratras, little girls will be worshipped in the \u201cKanjak Pujan\u201d, with some people even washing their feet. To me, this reeks of hypocrisy, unless it is reflected in the behaviour and treatment that women and girls around us are subjected to.Even though this statement might open me up to criticism from the gatekeepers of religion, my thoughts aren\u2019t random or meant to hurt sentiments, but a comment on the practical aspect of what I notice around me. I have seen too many people who continue to abuse their wives and practicing misogyny while fasting and worshipping the goddess. That is not to say that there aren\u2019t people out there who respect and honour women, but a lot remains to be desired as per the data and on-ground situation in the country.As per the recently released report by National Crime Record Bureau, crimes against women in India increased by 15.3 percent in 2021. Not only has the number of registered cases increased, but the rate of crimes against women has also seen an increase. The maximum complaints were related to the right to live with dignity that takes into account emotional abuse of women, followed by those related to domestic violence and dowry harassment.While women have stepped out and many are at the peak of the ladder of success, on the other hand, they continue to suffer violence by their own family members. Why not take a look at nine of the most pressing issues women in India continue to face, so we can work on those in the practical sense while faith inspires us?Despite many initiatives like \u201cBeti Bachao, Beti Padhao\u201d, India has one of the highest rates of female foeticide in the world. Even though it is heartening to see the sex ratio normalizing, India is the only large country in the world where more baby girls die than baby boys. As per Unicef, the gender differential in child survival is 11 per cent.In 1990, Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen coined the phrase \u201cmissing women\u201d showing that in parts of the developing world, the ratio of women to men in the population is suspiciously low. These girls are said to be \u2018Missing\u2019 because they should have been born and become part of the population but did not.As per a new research report prepared by the Pew Research Centre, Hindus have the highest number of female foeticide in India. The researchers got their data from the last three rounds of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) conducted by the Union government. According to the analysis, at least 9 million girls are \u201cmissing\u201d in India as a result of female infanticide from 2000 to 2019.As India\u2019s largest religious group, Hindus make up 79.8 per cent of the population and account for a share of 86.7 per cent of the missing female births, followed by Sikhs who comprise only 1.7 per cent of the population but contributed 4.9 per cent of missing births.Muslims account for 14 per cent of the population and account for 6.6 per cent missing births while Christians who make up 2.3 per cent of the population accounted for 0.6 per cent of missing births. This is telling and means that a lot more needs to be done in order to protect the girl child.There are about 189.2 million undernourished people in India, a majority of whom are women and children. Women, in general, are the ones who eat the last and the least in the family. It is a known fact that an undernourished mother will give birth to an undernourished baby, perpetuating a cycle of undernutrition. The prevalence of malnutrition and anaemia among almost half the population of women in India, especially pregnant women, should be a serious concern!There has been a lot of work in this area, but the gender gap continues to exist. Despite the many government schemes and initiatives, the female literacy rate is lower than the male literacy rate in both rural and urban areas. As of 2021, we recorded a higher nationwide share of men with at least 10 years of schooling.Around half of the male population between 15 and 49 years stayed in school for 10 years compared to only 41 per cent of their female counterparts.Indian women do a lot of work, but their work is not recognized as most of it is unskilled and domestic work. Household chores, working in the family field etc. are not counted. The percentage of working-age women who are economically active is far lower than the global average.Women toiling hard at construction sites are a common sight. As per the data from the Ministry of Labour and Employment, of the 40 million workers engaged in the Construction sector, 49 per cent are females. Despite doing equal physical labour, they are paid about Rs 300 as compared to Rs 500 a day that a male labourer makes.In addition to the labour, they are expected to do the household work like cleaning and cooking for the family. Even in the urban setup, women are given an uneven share of caregiving responsibilities, while the office workload remains the same. Familial and childrens\u2019 responsibilities also lie mainly with women.Even though many companies are doing a lot to check-in, it is not enough to ensure work-life balance and often leads to stress, and to women dropping out of the workplace. This was especially exacerbated during the covid-19 pandemic.A large percentage of women do not have the power to make decisions. They aren\u2019t allowed to take independent decisions related to their own lives. Women have to take permission of male members for everything. Even in government documents, they have to give their father\u2019s or husband\u2019s name. In many cases, they do not have a say in their own marriage.In the urban setup, many working women do not get to make decisions on handling their own money, instead handing over her salary to the mother-in-law or husband.Despite much talk on this issue, violence in Indian households remains a dirty little open secret, permeating across all strata of the society. According to the last NFHS Report, 29.3 per cent married Indian women between the ages of 18-49 years have faced domestic violence/or sexual violence. 3.1 per cent of pregnant women between the ages of 18-49 have experienced physical violence during any pregnancy.And that\u2019s just the number of cases reported by women; there are always a large number of cases that go unreported. Despite strict laws being in place, patriarchy, misogyny and violence continue to affect the daily lives of Indian women. The mental trauma of intimate partner violence continues to haunt most victims their entire lives.As many as 77 per cent women never sought any help from anyone about the violence inflicted on them. Many women opt to stay in abusive marriages. The more one faces violence in a relationship, the more normalised it becomes.Just because the Divorce Rate in India is not as high as compared to Western countries does not mean that Indian marriages are more successful. Divorce is looked down upon by the society. The labels of being a \u201cdivorcee\u201d or \u201csingle mom\u201d and its perceived impact on children stops many women from leaving abusive marriages.The lack of a strong support structure, fear of social judgement, and financial dependence on the husband to provide for the child are all contributing causes.Women who are raised in conservative, traditional households are not encouraged to work and told that husbands are \u201cPati Parmeswars\u201d and must be revered no matter what. They are trained from childhood to be dutiful daughters, sisters, and then wives, robbing them of any autonomy over their own lives.Gender-balanced cabinets are a crucial indicator of the commitment to achieving gender equality. Despite the share of women legislators in the Lok Sabha peaking at 14.39 per cent as of June 2019, India is still ranked 143 out of 193 countries in the representation of women in Parliament. The global average for the share of women parliamentarians stands at 24.6 per cent.The percentage of women judges in High Courts is a mere 11.5 per cent, while in the Supreme Court there are four sitting women judges out of 33 in office. The situation of women lawyers in the country is not any better. Out of 1.7 million advocates registered, only 15 per cent are women.Despite many reforms in the penal code for crimes of rape and sexual assault, India continues to be highly unsafe for women. As per the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, 65,025 rape cases were reported in 2021 in India and in a shocking 96.8 percent of the cases, the offenders were known to the victims. This is after the fact that many cases go unreported due to various factors.Rajasthan reported maximum rape cases at 6,337 in 2021 where 95.8 per cent of the victims knew the accused. In Madhya Pradesh, which registered the second highest rape cases at 3,515, 99.1 per cent of the victims knew the offender. In five states Maharashtra, Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and Sikkim 100 per cent of victims knew their rapists from before, according to the NCRB report.The maximum number of rape cases in India were committed by \u201cfamily, friends, neighbours or other known persons\u201d. Despite the staggering data, marital rape continues to remain de-criminalized in India, one of the few remaining countries where it's not a crime for a man to rape his wife.I hope we, as a society can rise above patriarchy and be sincere in respecting the women around us instead of showing devotion as a ritual and formality. Unless women have basic safety and equal rights, the rest will continue to be mere tokenism and nothing more.",

At Tehran University, dozens were detained, Tavsir1500 said. The semi-official Fars news agency said some protesters were arrested in a square near the university.A video posted on social media appeared to show protesters giving flowers to members of the riot police in Tehran, a recreation of Iranians winning over the military to their side in the 1979 Islamic revolution.Reuters could not verify the social media reports.The protests began at Amini's funeral on Sept. 17 and spread to Iran's 31 provinces, with all layers of society, including ethnic and religious minorities, taking part and many demanding Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's downfall.Amnesty International has said a government crackdown on demonstrations has so far led to the death of at least 52 people, with hundreds injured. Rights groups say dozens of activists, students and artists have been detained.In London, about 2,500 people, many of them Iranians, staged a noisy protest in Trafalgar Square. In Paris, a crowd of several dozen people held Iranian flags and pictures of victims who have died in the protests. In Madrid, an Iranian woman cut her hair during a protest attended by dozens of people, echoing demonstrations in Iran where women have also been waving and burning their veils during demonstrations.Iran's currency neared historic lows reached in June as desperate Iranians bought dollars to protect their savings, amid little hope Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers would be revived and concerns over the economic consequences of the unrest.The rial fell to 331,200 per U.S. dollar, compared with 321,200 on Friday, according to the foreign exchange site Bonbast.com. The currency had plummeted to an all-time low of 332,000 per dollar on June 12.Iranian authorities say many members of the security forces have been killed, accusing the United States of exploiting the unrest to try to destabilise Iran.The Revolutionary Guards said four members of its forces and the volunteer Basij militia were killed on Friday in attacks in Zahedan, capital of the southeastern Sistan-Baluchistan province.State television had said on Friday that 19 people, including members of the security forces, had been killed in Zahedan after unidentified individuals opened fire on a police station, prompting security forces to return fire.Authorities blamed a separatist group from the Baluchi minority for starting the shootout in Zahedan. State media said two prominent militants linked to that group had been killed.IRNA posted a video showing destroyed cars, an overturned and burning trailer or bus and fires in burnt-out buildings and shops, describing it as footage of \"what the terrorists did to people's shops last night in Zahedan\".Reuters could not verify the footage.Protests have been particularly intense in Iran's Kurdistan region, where authorities have previously put down unrest by the Kurdish minority numbering up to 10 million.Shops and businesses were on strike in 20 northwestern cities and towns in protest against attacks on Iraq-based armed Kurdish opposition parties by Iran's Revolutionary Guards, the Kurdish rights group Hengaw reported.Fearing an ethnic uprising, and in a show of power, Iran launched rocket and drone attacks on targets in Iraq's Kurdish region this week after accusing Iranian Kurdish dissidents of being involved in the unrest.Iran\u2019s Tasnim news agency reported new attacks by the Revolutionary Guards on Iraqi Kurdistan on Saturday.A senior member of Komala, an exiled Iranian Kurdish opposition party, told Reuters that two party offices in Halgurd mountain in Iraq's Erbil were struck in Iranian shelling.A Kurdish security official said Iranian artillery also shelled Choman district in Erbil.",

Engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have found a way to track it, while the patient remains at home. They have designed an in-home device.The development will pave way for better evaluation of the neurological condition's progression, especially for people who live far from cities and hospitals. Parkinson's is evaluated by testing their motor skills and cognitive functions during clinic visits and according to MIT, more than 40 per cent of individuals with Parkinson\u2019s are never treated by a neurologist or Parkinson\u2019s specialist.Parkinson's disease, according to the National Institute of Aging, is a brain disorder that causes unintended or uncontrollable movements. It could also involve mental and behavioral changes, sleep problems, depression, memory difficulties, and fatigue.Also Read | Prez Murmu inaugurates HAL's new facility to build cryogenic engines for Isro rocketsThe new device can monitor a patient\u2019s movement and gait speed, which can be used to evaluate Parkinson\u2019s severity, the progression of the disease, and the patient\u2019s response to medication. The details have been published in Science Translational Medicine.\u201cBy being able to have a device in the home that can monitor a patient and tell the doctor remotely about the progression of the disease, and the patient\u2019s medication response so they can attend to the patient even if the patient can\u2019t come to the clinic \u2014 now they have real, reliable information \u2014 that actually goes a long way toward improving equity and access,\u201d senior author of the study detailing the device Dina Katabi, said in a statement.The size of a wi-fi router, the device gathers data passively using radio signals that reflect off the patient\u2019s body as they move around their home, and there is no need for the patient to wear any gadget or change their behaviour in any way.Also Read | For our dinosaurs: Earth strikes back as Dart bangs asteroid in epic missionThe team of researchers conducted a one-year at-home study with 50 participants of whom 34 had Parkinson's and used machine-learning algorithms to analyze the troves of data.

Researchers said that while radio signals pass through walls and other solid objects, they are reflected off humans due to the water in our bodies. Since radio signals travel at the same speed, they can convey the movement details depending on the length of time it takes the signals to reflect back.\u201cMonitoring the patient continuously as they move around the room enabled us to get really good measurements of their gait speed.

The alleged kidnapping took place when President Putin annexed four Ukrainian regions, AFP said in a report. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN's watchdog agency, questioned Russian forces about the alleged abduction.-Moscow withdrew its troops from the eastern city of Lyman in Ukraine on Saturday, a stronghold for Kyiv, after being encircled by Ukrainian forces. This came after Putin signed treaties to annex more occupied Ukrainian territory. \"Allied forces were withdrawn from the settlement of ... Lyman to more advantageous lines because of the creation of the threat of encirclement,\" Russia's Ministry of Defence said.-Ukraine released a video of the capture in which Ukrainian troops can be seen throwing Russian flags down from the building's roof and raising a Ukrainian flag in their place.In a late night video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that fighting is still going on in Lyman in the Donetsk region.-Christine Lambrecht, Germany's defence minister, made a surprise visit to Ukraine ever since Russia's invasion in February.

The notice was issued based on an application filed by Acres Buildwell, which claimed that SpiceJet owes the firm Rs 3.25 crore in outstanding dues.Earlier, the NCLT had granted SpiceJet two weeks to file its reply on the plea as to why insolvency resolution proceedings should not be initiated against it.Earlier this year, SpiceJet had reached a settlement with Credit Suisse AG, which had sought the winding up of the airline over unpaid dues. The airline had reached an in-principle settlement with Credit Suisse AG over pending dues of $ 24 million.The Supreme Court had also stopped the insolvency proceedings against SpiceJet and asked it to clear its dues earlier.SpiceJet had recently said in a statement that it is in talks with bankers to raise as much as $200 million in fresh capital after the private airline reported a net loss of Rs 789 crore in the last quarter.READ | SpiceJet still cannot fly at full capacity.

    "content": "Both Florida and Cuba are preparing for Hurricane Ian to bring devastating winds and storm surges to their coasts this week.The storm is expected to make landfall in Cuba on Monday and then lash Florida with storm surges and downpours.Ian follows Hurricane Fiona, a powerful Category 4 storm that carved a path of destruction last week through Puerto Rico, leaving most of the U.S. territory without power and potable water. Fiona then barreled through the Turks and Caicos Islands, skirted Bermuda and slammed into Canada's Atlantic coast, where critical infrastructure might take months to repair.Also Read | Nasa to move Artemis-1 moon rocket to safety, launch unlikely in OctWhile scientists haven't yet determined whether climate change influenced Fiona or Ian, there's strong evidence that these devastating storms are getting worse.Here's why.Yes, climate change is making hurricanes wetter, windier and altogether more intense. There is also evidence that it is causing storms to travel more slowly, meaning they can dump more water in one place.If it weren't for the oceans, the planet would be much hotter due to climate change. But in the last 40 years, the ocean has absorbed about 90% of the warming caused by heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions. Much of this ocean heat is contained near the water's surface. This additional heat can fuel a storm's intensity and power stronger winds.Climate change can also boost the amount of rainfall delivered by a storm. Because a warmer atmosphere can also hold more moisture, water vapor builds up until clouds break, sending down heavy rain.During the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season \u2014 one of the most active on record \u2014 climate change boosted hourly rainfall rates in hurricane-force storms by 8%-11%, according to an April 2022 study in the journal Nature Communications.Also Read | Pakistan floods raise fears of hunger after crops wreckedThe world has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial average. Scientists at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) expect that, at 2C of warming, hurricane wind speeds could increase by up to 10%.NOAA also projects the proportion of hurricanes that reach the most intense levels \u2014 Category 4 or 5 \u2014 could rise by about 10% this century. To date, less than a fifth of storms have reached this intensity since 1851.A fisherman prepares to move his boat from a canal ahead of the arrival of Tropical Storm Ian in Havana, Cuba, September 26, 2022. REUTERS/Alexandre MeneghiniThe typical \"season\" for hurricanes is shifting, as climate warming creates conditions conducive to storms in more months of the year. And hurricanes are also making landfall in regions far outside the historic norm.In the United States, Florida sees the most hurricanes make landfall, with more than 120 direct hits since 1851, according to NOAA. But in recent years, some storms are reaching peak intensity and making landfall farther north than in the past a poleward shift may be related to rising global air and ocean temperatures, scientists said.Also Read | China sounds Red Alert as biggest freshwater lake goes dryThis trend is worrying for mid-latitude cities such as New York, Boston, Beijing, and Tokyo, where \"infrastructure is not prepared\" for such storms, said atmospheric scientist Allison Wing at Florida State University.Hurricane Sandy, though only a Category 1 storm, was the fourth costliest U.S. hurricane on record, causing $81 billion in losses when it hit the Northeastern Seaboard in 2012.As for timing, hurricane activity is common for North America from June through November, peaking in September after a summertime buildup of warm water conditions.However, the first named storms to make U.S. landfall now do so more than three weeks earlier than they did in 1900, nudging the start of the season into May, according to a study published in August in Nature Communications.The same trend appears to be playing out across the world in Asia's Bay of Bengal, where cyclones since 2013 have been forming earlier than usual - in April and May - ahead of the summer monsoon, according to a November 2021 study in Scientific Reports.It's unclear, however, if climate change is affecting the number of hurricanes that form each year. One team of scientists recently reported detecting a rise in frequency for North Atlantic hurricanes over the last 150 years, according to their study published in December in Nature Communications. But research is still ongoing.Also Read | World leaders pledge more support for nature ahead of UN summitHurricanes need two main ingredients \u2014 warm ocean water and moist, humid air. When warm seawater evaporates, its heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere. This fuels the storm's winds to strengthen. Without it, hurricanes can't intensify and will fizzle out.While technically the same phenomenon, these big storms get different names depending on where and how they were formed.Storms that form over the Atlantic Ocean or central and eastern North Pacific are called \"hurricanes\" when their wind speeds reach at least 74 miles per hour (119 kilometers per hour). Up to that point, they're known as \"tropical storms.\"In East Asia, violent, swirling storms that form over the Northwest Pacific are called \"typhoons\", while \"cyclones\" emerge over the Indian Ocean and South Pacific.Also Read | How many ants are there on Earth?

There is very little to go to reach 50% plus one vote,\" he said.Bolsonaro, a 67-year-old former army captain who spent nearly three decades in Congress pushing his pro-gun, anti-gay and anti-abortion agenda, was swept into office in 2018 on a wave of conservative backlash to Lula's Workers Party.He closed his re-election campaign with motorcycle rallies in Sao Paulo and the southern state of Santa Catarina.Lula rode in an open car and then walked with thousands of cheering supporters who turned out in central Sao Paulo, eager to see him despite drizzling rain. The event was called the \"Walk of Victory.\"The Workers Party has booked a rally on Sao Paulo's midtown Paulista Avenue for Sunday night to celebrate victory by the 76-year-former union leader, who co-founded the party in 1980 and has run six times on its presidential ticket.Brazil's electronic voting system, which Bolsonaro has called vulnerable to fraud without providing evidence, allows the national electoral authority (TSE), to quickly tally results within hours after polls close at 5 p.m. (2000 GMT).The head of the TSE, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, called on Brazilians by Twitter to celebrate the country's democracy by turning out to vote with \"peace, security and harmony, respect and freedom.\"",

However, India are still waiting and hoping Bumrah proves his fitness for the T20 World Cup later this month.Although the likes of Mohammed Shami and Deepak Chahar are among the standby players for India's campaign in Australia, Mohammed Siraj has managed to knock on the doors as he replaced Bumrah for the remainder of the T20I series against South Africa.\"The player I would put in if Jasprit\u2019s not available is Mohammad Siraj, because of the firepower he presents,\" Watson said on the ICC Review. \"Without Bumrah, that\u2019s the one thing India won\u2019t necessarily have, which is vital on Australian wickets on the bigger grounds with the pace and bounce.\"Siraj is great with the brand new ball. He is fast, he swings the ball away but also his defensive skills are pretty good. And he\u2019s got better over the last couple of years, with what we\u2019ve seen in the IPL. So, for me he\u2019s probably going to be the one who is going to have the most impact.\"The former Australia cricketer further said that Bumrah's absence will have a huge impact on India's campaign at the T20 World Cup.

    "content": "Florida and the Carolinas, staggered by one of the fiercest storms in U.S. history, faced a massive recovery on Saturday as remnants of Hurricane Ian threatened further flooding along the Eastern Seaboard while leaving tens of billions of dollars in damage in its wake.The number of confirmed fatalities from Ian rose to at least 50, most in Lee County, Florida, which bore the brunt of the storm when it slammed ashore on the state's Gulf Coast on Wednesday as a Category 4 hurricane packing maximum sustained winds of 150 miles (240 km) per hour.The death toll was expected to climb as floodwaters receded and search teams reached more areas initially cut off by the storm.As of Friday, some 10,000 people were reported unaccounted for in Florida, according to the state's emergency management director, who added that many of those were likely safe in shelters or otherwise unreachable because of power and phone outages.ALSO READ | Hurricane Ian looks furious from space as Category-3 storm hits CubaAs the full extent of devastation came into clearer focus three days after Ian made U.S. landfall, officials said some of the heaviest damage appeared to have been inflicted by raging wind-driven ocean surf that rushed into seaside communities and washed buildings away.New satellite images from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) showed beach cottages and a motel building that lined the shores of Florida's Sanibel Island had been demolished by Ian's storm surge. Although most homes appeared to still be standing, roof damage to all was evident.Surveys from the ground showed that the barrier island, a popular tourist getaway that was home to some 6,000 residents, was left utterly ravaged, from its infrastructure to its famously idyllic aesthetic character.\"It's all just completely gone,\" Sanibel's city manager, Dana Souza, said. \"Our electric system is pretty much destroyed, our sewer system has been damaged badly and our public water supply is under assessment.\"The island's link to the mainland was severed by breaches to Sanibel's causeway bridge, further complicating recovery efforts, Souza said.After waning to a tropical storm by the end of its march across Florida to the Atlantic, Ian regained hurricane strength and pummeled coastal South Carolina on Friday, sweeping ashore near Georgetown, north of the historic port city of Charleston, with sustained winds reaching 85 mph (140 kph).Numerous roads were flooded and blocked by fallen trees while a number of piers were damaged in that area.ALSO READ | Waning Hurricane Ian creeps across Florida after battering Gulf CoastWeakening again as it churned north and inland, Ian had been downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone by Saturday afternoon. But remnants of the storm were still expected to bring treacherous conditions to parts of the central Appalachians and mid-Atlantic, according to the National Hurricane Center.Flood watches were posted for southwestern Virginia and southern West Virginia on Saturday, even as major to record flooding was forecast to continue in central Florida.About 1.2 million homes and businesses were without power in Florida as of 1 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT) on Saturday, with some 300,000 outages scattered across the Carolinas and Virginia.Florida accounted for the overwhelming majority of confirmed storm-related deaths, with 35 tallied by the Lee County sheriff's office and 11 others reported by state officials in four neighboring counties.North Carolina authorities said at least four more people had perished there. No deaths were reported in South Carolina.ALSO READ | Never seen so much lightning: Storm chaser on flight to eye of Hurricane Ian | WatchDamage from high water, unleashed by storm surge along the coast and torrential rains further inland, was extensive.\"We suffered more flood damage than wind damage,\" Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said Saturday. \"That is going to require a lot of flood claims being filed.\"Insurers braced for between $28 billion and $47 billion in claims from what could amount to the costliest Florida storm since Hurricane Andrew in 1992, according to U.S. property data and analytics company CoreLogic.President Joe Biden has approved a disaster declaration for Florida, saying Ian was \"likely to rank among the worst (storms) ... in the nation's history.\" On Saturday, he declared an emergency in North Carolina.On Sanibel, crews were just making their way to the hard-hit east end of that island on Saturday, \"so our situation is that we're still in the search-and-rescue mode,\" the city manager, Souza said.City officials were aware of nearly 300 households of people who failed to leave the island as the storm approached and whose whereabouts and well-being were now being checked, he said.Ricky Anderson, 57, a cashier who moved recently from Illinois to the nearby Fort Myers area, said he \"lost everything in the hurricane,\" as did many of his neighbors.\"Where are all those people supposed to go that have no home anymore?\" Anderson said.Robert Hartman, 81, a 50-year-resident of Fort Myers, said government help was crucial to get residents back on their feet.\"We have no power, no phone service, nothing.

Managers will assess their options once the 322-foot (98-meter) Space Launch System rocket is safely back in the hangar. A pair of launch attempts were thwarted by hydrogen fuel leaks and other technical problems.Watch |  Nasa crashes Dart spacecraft on asteroid, Armageddon styleThe Hurricane, which has been strengthening, lashed heavy rains and winds on the western tip of Cuba with over 50,000 people being evacuated to safety. The hurricane is on a path that could see it hit Florida\u2019s west coast as a Category 4 hurricane. After passing over Cuba, Ian was forecast to strengthen further over warm Gulf of Mexico waters before reaching Florida as early as Wednesday as a Category 4 storm with top winds of 225 kilometers per hour.The predictions have forced Nasa to not only abandon the September 27 launch window but also October 2, forcing the mission to be delayed to November.The $4.1 billion test flight will kick off Nasa\u2019s return to the moon since the Apollo moonshots of the 1960s and 1970s.

    "content": "It was 65 million years ago when an asteroid came hurtling towards Earth and struck a deadly blow. The impact was so strong that it wiped the entire species of dinosaurs and other living things from the surface of the planet. Finally, Earth has hit back.A small, yet powerful spacecraft slammed into an asteroid in the wee hours of Tuesday in a test of a technology that could pave the way to hit asteroids and other alien objects, if they are headed directly towards us in the future. The Dart mission banged into a moonlet of an asteroid to slightly change its orbit, giving Earth its avengers moment for the dinosaurs.The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (Dart) mission was launched in November 2021 to travel deep into space, over 9 million kilometers away from Earth, to test the kinetic impactor technology that could be deployed in case an alien object comes crashing towards us. The world\u2019s first planetary defense technology demonstration was successful in its mission.Don't want to miss a thing? Watch the final moments from the #DARTMission on its collision course with asteroid Dimporphos. pic.twitter.com/2qbVMnqQrD\u201cAt its core, DART represents an unprecedented success for planetary defense, but it is also a mission of unity with a real benefit for all humanity. As we study the cosmos and our home planet, we\u2019re also working to protect that home, and this international collaboration turned science fiction into science fact, demonstrating one way to protect Earth,\u201d NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said after the epic mission.Also Read | King Tut hides ancient Egyptian secret, location of Queen Nefertiti's tombThe spacecraft, equipped with a sole camera, working autonomously not only tracked the Dimorphos asteroid but also charted its course using Jupiter and navigated its way onto the asteroid's surface. The spacecraft beamed back out worldly footage of its approach as the asteroid became bigger and bigger in every frame before it struck it and a loss of signal was confirmed.The Armageddon-inspired mission was tracked globally with both space and ground-based telescopes looking at it. Both the Hubble and the mighty James Webb Telescope zoomed in to see the event. Nasa has said that the investigation team will now observe Dimorphos using ground-based telescopes to confirm that DART\u2019s impact altered the asteroid\u2019s orbit around Didymos.Also Read | Nasa crashes Dart spacecraft on asteroid, Armageddon styleThe collision is expected to shorten Dimorphos\u2019 orbit by about 1%, or roughly 10 minutes; precisely measuring how much the asteroid was deflected is one of the primary purposes of the full-scale test.\u201cPlanetary Defense is a globally unifying effort that affects everyone living on Earth. Now we know we can aim a spacecraft with the precision needed to impact even a small body in space. Just a small change in its speed is all we need to make a significant difference in the path an asteroid travels,\u201d Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate added.The 570-kilogram box-shaped spacecraft crashed into the Dimorphos at 24,000 kilometers per hour to slightly slow the asteroid\u2019s orbital speed. By changing orbital speed, Nasa aims to slightly alter the orbital dynamic of objects that come towards us and change their course.With a bullseye hit, all eyes will be on the science data that will be released in the coming weeks that will further validate the system.Also Read | Black hole at center of our galaxy is not alone",

    "content": "Venezuela on Saturday freed seven Americans, including five oil executives, in exchange for two relatives of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro jailed in the United States on drug convictions, US officials said.The swap included executives of Citgo Petroleum held for years, in addition to US Marine veteran Matthew Heath and another US citizen named Osman Khan. They were exchanged for two of Maduro's wife's nephews, who were arrested in 2015.President Joe Biden said in a statement that the \"wrongfully detained\" Americans would soon be reunited with their relatives.\"Today, we celebrate that seven families will be whole once more. To all the families who are still suffering and separated from their loved ones who are wrongfully detained know that we remain dedicated to securing their release,\" Biden said.The prisoner transfer, which one US official said took place at an airport in an unspecified third country, followed months of secretive talks with Maduro's socialist government, which is under strict US sanctions, including on the OPEC nation's energy sector.It came at a time when Washington is under growing pressure to do more to secure freedom for dozens of Americans held abroad. Much of the Biden administration's focus has been on Russia's detention of WNBA star Brittney Griner and another American, Paul Whelan.Maduro's government said in a statement that as a result of talks that started in March, two young Venezuelans \"unjustly\" held in the United States were freed, as well as a group of US citizens who were subject to Venezuelan court proceedings and were released for \"humanitarian reasons.\"The freed Americans were all in stable health and \"overjoyed to be heading home,\" while the two Venezuelans were en route back to the South American country, a senior Biden administration official told reporters in a telephone briefing.Biden approved the exchange weeks ago, making a \"tough decision, a painful decision\" that the release of the two Venezuelans was essential to securing the Americans' freedom. US officials have previously said in private that Maduro wanted to use the detainees as bargaining chips.The swap, which included Biden granting clemency to the two Venezuelans who US authorities had dubbed the \"narco nephews,\" has not altered Washington's policy toward Venezuela, a senior administration official said.The Biden administration has only slightly eased Trump-era sanctions on Venezuela, saying it will consider more significant steps if Maduro returns to negotiations with the Venezuelan opposition and there is progress toward free elections.An increased flow of Venezuelan oil to world markets could help replace some of the Russian supplies hit by international sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, experts say.The five employees of Houston-based Citgo, who had been detained in Venezuela in 2017, were Tomeu Vadell, Jose Luis Zambrano, Alirio Zambrano, Jorge Toledo and Jose Pereira.Also released was Heath, a former Marine hospitalized following what his family said was a suicide attempt in June. He had been held since 2020 on terrorism charges, which he denied.Khan was identified as a Florida man who had been arrested in January.In return, the Unites States freed two of Venezuelan first lady Cilia Flores' nephews, Franqui Flores and Efrain Antonio Campo Flores.The two, arrested in Haiti in 2015 in a US Drug Enforcement Administration sting operation, were convicted in 2016 on US charges that they tried to carry out a multimillion-dollar cocaine deal. They were each sentenced in 2017 to 18 years in prison.The prisoner handover, the largest since Biden took office in January 2020, occurred in \"a country in between Venezuela and the United States\" after the men arrived on separate planes, a senior US official said.Citgo welcomed the news that the executives were free, saying in a statement it was \"grateful to the leaders in Washington who helped bring about their release.\"A Venezuelan court in 2020 sentenced the executives, accused of embezzlement, money laundering and conspiracy, to prison terms ranging from eight to 13 years. They and the company maintained their innocence, and the US State Department called the charges \"specious.\"\"We applaud President Biden for having the courage to make this deal and encourage him and the administration to continue building upon the momentum,\" said Jonathan Franks, spokesperson for the Bring our Families Home campaign, which advocates for Americans wrongfully held overseas.At least four other Americans are still detained in Venezuela, including two former US Army Special Forces members, Luke Denman and Airan Berry, who were arrested in 2020 in connection with a botched raid aimed at ousting Maduro.Venezuela released two jailed US citizens in March following a visit to Caracas by the highest-level US delegation in years.Read | Ukraine exchanges prisoners with Russia, 12 soldiers coming home",

    "content": "Dozens of Florida residents left their flooded and splintered homes by boat and by air on Saturday as rescuers continued to search for survivors in the wake of Hurricane Ian, while authorities in South Carolina and North Carolina began taking stock of their losses.The death toll from the storm, one of the strongest hurricanes by wind speed to ever hit the US, grew to more than four dozen, with 47 deaths confirmed in Florida, four in North Carolina and three deaths in Cuba. The storm weakened Saturday as it rolled into the mid-Atlantic, but not before it washed out bridges and piers, hurdled massive boats into buildings onshore and sheared roofs off homes, leaving hundreds of thousands without power.The bulk of the deaths confirmed in Florida were mostly from drowning in storm waters, but others from Ian\u2019s tragic aftereffects. An elderly couple died after their oxygen machines shut off when they lost power, authorities said.As of Saturday, more than 1,000 people had been rescued from flooded areas along Florida\u2019s southwestern coast alone, Daniel Hokanson, a four-star general and head of the National Guard, told The Associated Press while airborne to Florida.Later in the evening, the White House announced that President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden would travel to Florida on Wednesday. No other details of Biden\u2019s visit were immediately released.Read | Joe Biden warns of substantial deaths as Hurricane Ian wipes out homes in FloridaChris Schnapp was at the Port Sanibel Marina in Fort Myers on Saturday, waiting to see whether her 83-year-old mother-in-law had been evacuated from Sanibel Island. A pontoon boat had just arrived with a load of passengers from the island \u2014 with suitcases and animals in tow \u2014 but Schnapp\u2019s mother-in-law was not among them.\u201cShe stayed on the island. My brother-in-law and sister-in-law own two businesses over there. They evacuated. She did not want to go,\u201d Schnapp said. Now, she said, she wasn\u2019t sure if her mother-in-law was still on the island or had been taken to a shelter somewhere.On Pine Island, the largest barrier island off Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast, houses were reduced to splinters and boats littered roadways as a volunteer rescue group went door-to-door Saturday, asking isolated residents if they wanted to be evacuated. Residents described the horror of being trapped in their homes as water kept rising.\u201cThe water just kept pounding the house and we watched, boats, houses \u2014 we watched everything just go flying by,\u201d said Joe Conforti, as he fought back tears. He said if it wasn\u2019t for his wife, who suggested they get up on a table to avoid the rising water, he wouldn\u2019t have made it: \u201cI started to lose sensibility, because when the water\u2019s at your door and it\u2019s splashing on the door and you\u2019re seeing how fast it\u2019s moving, there\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to survive that.\u201dRiver flooding posed a major challenge at times to rescue and supply delivery efforts. The Myakka River washed over a stretch of Interstate 75, forcing a traffic-snarling highway closure for a while Saturday. That\u2019s a key corridor linking Tampa to the north with the hard-hit southwest Florida region that straddles Port Charlotte and Fort Myers. Later Saturday, state officials said, water levels had receded enough that I-75 could be fully reopened.While rising waters in Florida\u2019s southwest rivers have crested or are near cresting, the levels aren\u2019t expected to drop significantly for days, said National Weather Service meteorologist Tyler Fleming in Tampa.Elsewhere, South Carolina\u2019s Pawleys Island \u2014 a beach community roughly 75 miles (115 kilometers) up the coast from Charleston \u2014 was among the places hardest hit. Power remained knocked out to at least half of the island Saturday.Eddie Wilder, who has been coming to Pawleys Island for more than six decades, said Friday\u2019s storm was \u201cinsane.\u201d He said waves as high as 25 feet (7.6 meters) washed away the local pier \u2014 an iconic landmark.\u201cWe watched it hit the pier and saw the pier disappear,\u201d said Wilder, whose house 30 feet (9 meters) above the ocean stayed dry inside. \u201cWe watched it crumble and watched it float by with an American flag.\u201dThe Pawleys pier was one of at least four along South Carolina\u2019s coast destroyed by battering winds and rain. Meanwhile, the intracoastal waterway was strewn with the remnants of several boat houses knocked off their pilings.John Joseph, whose father built the family\u2019s beige beach house in 1962, said Saturday he was elated to return from Georgetown \u2014 which took a direct hit. He found his Pawleys Island home entirely intact.\u201cThank God these walls are still here, and we feel very blessed that this is the worst thing,\u201d he said of sand that had swept under his home. \u201cWhat happened in Florida \u2014 gosh, God bless us.

The outages were down sharply hours later, after crews worked to restore power.Two of the North Carolina deaths were from storm-related vehicle crashes, while officials said a man also drowned when his truck plunged into a swamp, and another man was killed by carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator in a garage.At Port Sanibel Marina in Fort Myers, charter boat captain Ryan Kane inspected damage to two boats on Saturday. The storm surge pushed several boats and a dock onshore. He said the boat he owns was totaled so he couldn\u2019t use it to help rescue people. Now, he said, it would be a long time before he\u2019d be chartering fishing clients again.\u201cThere\u2019s a hole in the hull. It took water in the motors.

They included a deep sunless pit in a residential compound with dates carved in the brick wall, a clammy underground jail that reeked of urine and rotting food, a medical clinic, a police station and a kindergarten.The AP spoke to 15 survivors of Russian torture in the Kharkiv region, as well as two families whose loved ones disappeared into Russian hands. Two of the men were taken repeatedly and abused. One battered, unconscious Ukrainian soldier was displayed to his wife to force her to provide information she simply didn\u2019t have.The AP also confirmed eight men were killed under torture in Russian custody, according to survivors and families. All but one were civilians.At a mass grave site created by the Russians and discovered in the woods of Izium, at least 30 of the 447 bodies recently excavated bore visible marks of torture \u2014 bound hands, close gunshot wounds, knife wounds and broken limbs, according to the Kharkiv regional prosecutor\u2019s office. Those injuries corresponded to the descriptions of the pain inflicted upon the survivors.AP journalists also saw bodies with bound wrists at the mass grave. Amid the trees were hundreds of simple wooden crosses, most marked only with numbers. One said it contained the bodies of 17 Ukrainian soldiers. At least two more mass graves have been found in the town, all heavily mined, authorities said.A physician who treated hundreds of Izium\u2019s injured during the Russian occupation said people regularly arrived at his emergency room with injuries consistent with torture, including gunshots to their hands and feet, broken bones and severe bruising, and burns. None would explain their wounds, he said.\u201cEven if people came to the hospital, silence was the norm,\u201d chief Dr Yuriy Kuznetsov said. He added that one soldier came in for treatment for hand injuries, clearly from being cuffed, but the man refused to say what happened.Men with links to Ukrainian forces were singled out repeatedly for torture, but any adult man risked getting caught up. Matilda Bogner, the head of the UN human rights mission in Ukraine, told the AP they had documented \u201cwidespread practices of torture or ill-treatment of civilian detainees\u201d by Russian forces and affiliates. Torture of soldiers was also systemic, she said.Torture in any form during an armed conflict is a war crime under the Geneva Conventions, whether of prisoners of war or civilians.\u201cIt serves three purposes,\u201d said Rachel Denber of Human Rights Watch. \u201cTorture comes with questionsabout coercing information,but it is also to punish and to sow fear. It is to send a chilling message to everyone else.\u201dAP journalists found Kotsar, 26, hiding in a monastery in Izium, his blond hair tied back neatly in the Orthodox fashion and his beard curling beneath his chin. He had no way to safely contact his loved ones, who thought he was dead.Back in March, after his first round of torture, Kotsar fled to the gold-domed Pishchanskyi church. Russian soldiers were everywhere, and nowhere in Izium was safe.Hiding amid the icons, Kotsar listened to the rumble of Russian armored vehicles outside and contemplated suicide. He had been a soldier for just under a month and had no idea if anyone in his little unit had survived the Russian onslaught.When he emerged from the church a few days later, a Russian patrol caught him. They kept him for a week. His captors\u2019 idea of a joke was to shave his legs with a knife, and then debate aloud whether to slice off the limb entirely.\u201cThey took, I don\u2019t know what exactly, some iron, maybe glass rods, and burned the skin little by little,\u201d he said.He knew nothing that could help them. So they set him free again, and again he sought refuge with the monks. He had nowhere else to go.By then, the church and monastery compound had become a shelter for around 100 people, including 40 children. Kotsar took up a version of the monastic life, living with the black-robed brothers, helping them care for the refugees and spending his free hours standing before the gilt icons in contemplation.In the meantime, Izium was transforming into a Russian logistical hub. The town was swarming with troops, and its electricity, gas, water and phone networks were severed. Izium was effectively cut off from the rest of Ukraine.It was also in the spring that the Russians first sought out Mykola Mosyakyn, driving down the rutted dirt roads until they reached the Ukrainian soldier\u2019s fenced cottage. Mosyakyn, 38, had enlisted after the war began, though not in the same unit as Kotsar.They tossed him into a pit with standing water, handcuffed him and hung him by the restraints until his skin went numb. They waited in vain for him to talk, and tried again.\u201cThey beat me with sticks. They hit me with their hands, they kicked me, they put out cigarettes on me, they pressed matches on me,\u201d he recounted. \u201cThey said, \u2018Dance,\u2019 but I did not dance. So they shot my feet.\u201dAfter three days, they dropped him near the hospital with the command: \u201cTell them you had an accident.\u201dAt least two other men from Mosyakyn\u2019s neighborhood, a father and son who are both civilians, were taken at the same time. The father speaks about his two weeks in the basement cell in a whisper, staring at the ground. His adult son refuses to speak about it at all.That family, along with another man who was also tortured in the basement cell on Izium\u2019s east bank, spoke on condition of anonymity. They are terrified the Russians will return.Mosyakyn was captured again by a different Russian unit just a few days later. This time, he found himself in School No. 2, subject to routine beatings along with other Ukrainians. AP journalists found a discarded Ukrainian soldier\u2019s jacket in the same blue cell he described in detail. The school also served as a base and field hospital for Russian soldiers, and at least two Ukrainian civilians held there died.But the soldiers again freed Mosyakyn. To this day, he doesn\u2019t know why.Nor does he understand why they\u2019d release him just to recapture him a few days later and haul him to a crowded garage of a medical clinic near the railroad tracks. More than a dozen other Ukrainians were jailed with him, soldiers and civilians. Two garages were for men, one for women and a bigger one \u2014 the only one with a window \u2014 for Russian soldiers.Women were held in the garage closest to the soldiers\u2019 quarters. Their screams came at night, according to Mosyakyn and Kotsar, who were both held at the clinic at different times. Ukrainian intelligence officials said they were raped regularly.For the men, Room 6 was for electrocution. Room 9 was for waterboarding, Mosyakyn said. He described how they covered his face with a cloth bag and poured water from a kettle onto him to mimic the sensation of drowning. They also hooked up his toes to electricity and shocked him with electrodes on his ears.It was here that Mosyakyn watched Russian soldiers drag out the lifeless bodies of two civilians they\u2019d tortured to death, both from Izium\u2019s Gonkharovka neighborhood.Kotsar was taken to the clinic in July and received slightly different treatment, involving a Soviet-era gas mask and electrodes on his legs. AP journalists also found gas masks at two schools.By the time Kotsar arrived, people had already been there for 12 to 16 days. They told him their arms and legs were broken, and people taken out to be shot. He vowed that if he survived, he would never allow himself to be captured again.They released him after a couple of weeks. He craved familiar faces and people who meant him no harm. He returned to the monks.\u201cWhen I came out, everything was green. It was very, very strange, because there had been absolutely no color,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything was wonderful, so vivid.\u201dIn mid-August, the bodies of three men were found in a shallow forested pit on the town\u2019s outskirts.Ivan Shabelnyk left home with a friend on March 23 to collect pine cones so the family could light the samovar and have tea. They never came back.Another man taken with them reluctantly told Shabelnyk\u2019s family about the torture they\u2019d all endured together, first in the basement of a nearby house and then in School No. 2. Then he left town.Their bodies were found in mid-August, in the last days of the occupation, by a man scavenging for firewood. He followed the smell of death to a shallow grave in the forest.Shabelnyk\u2019s hands were shot, his ribs broken, his face unrecognizable. They identified him by the jacket he wore, from the local grain factory where he worked. His grieving mother showed the AP a photo.\u201cHe kept this photo with him, of us together when he was a small boy,\u201d said Ludmila Shabelnyk, in tears. \u201cWhy did they destroy people like him? I don\u2019t understand. Why has this happened to our country?\u201dHis sister, Olha Zaparozhchenko, walked with journalists through the cemetery and looked at his grave.\u201cThey tortured civilians at will, like bullies,\u201d she said. \u201cI have only one word: genocide.\u201dThe Kharkiv region\u2019s chief prosecutor, Oleksandr Filchakov, told the AP it was too soon to determine how many people were tortured in Izium, but said it easily numbered into the dozens.\u201cEvery day, many people call us with information, people who were in the occupied territories,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day, relatives come to us and say their friends, their family, were tortured by Russian soldiers.\u201dMISSING NO MOREAfter his final escape, Kotsar hid in the monastery for more than a month. Without documents and a phone connection to prove his identity, he was too afraid to leave.Kotsar\u2019s family had no idea what happened to him. They had simply reported him missing, like so many other Ukrainian soldiers caught on the wrong side of the frontline.He spoke with effort to AP journalists, and at one point asked them to turn off the camera so he could compose himself. The AP contacted the Commissioner for Issues of Missing Persons Under Special Circumstances, which confirmed the missing person report and his identity through a photo on file. Then Kotsar\u2019s own unit, which had left Izium in disarray, returned and tracked him down.Kotsar doesn\u2019t know what comes next. Ukrainian officials are still in the process of restoring his identity documents, and without them he can\u2019t go anywhere. He would like psychological treatment to deal with the trauma from repeated torture, and for now he\u2019s staying with the monks.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for them, I probably wouldn\u2019t have survived at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThey saved me.\u201dKotsar\u2019s first call was to the sister of his best friend \u2014 the only person in his entire circle of loved ones he was certain was in a safe place. He grinned as the connection went through.\u201cTell him I\u2019m alive,\u201d he said. \u201cTell him I\u2019m alive and in one piece.\u201dRead | 'Putin cornered, might go nuclear': Ex-CIA official on Russia-Ukraine war",

    "content": "The rupee plunged 90 paise to close at an all-time low of 80.86 (provisional) against the US dollar on Thursday after the US Federal Reserve's interest rate hike and its hawkish stance weighed on investor sentiments.Forex traders said the US Fed's rate hike and escalation of geopolitical risk in Ukraine sapped risk appetite.Moreover, the strength of the American currency in the overseas market, a muted trend in domestic equities, risk-off mood and firm crude oil prices weighed on the rupee.At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local currency opened at 80.27, then fell further to an all-time intra-day low of 80.95 against the American currency.It finally ended at 80.86, down 90 paise over its previous close of 79.96.The US Fed hiked interest rates by 75 basis points to 3-3.25 per cent. It was the third straight 75 basis points hike. Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank's commitment to taming inflation.Focus will be on Bank of Japan (BoJ) and Bank of England (BoE) monetary policies next, forex traders said.Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, advanced 0.38 per cent to 110.06.Besides the hawkish US Fed stance, the US Dollar extended gains against its major crosses after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced partial military mobilisation.\"An aggressive Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Russian President Vladimir Putin's escalation of geopolitical risk in Ukraine turned on the green light for King Dollar against most currencies,\" said Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities.Rupee along with other Asian peers tumbled to a record low.\"We believe the current downtrend in the rupee may continue for a while even after strong domestic fundamentals. The local currency will react to a stronger greenback but there could be outperformance among the regional currencies,\" Parmar said, adding that spot USD-INR now has resistance in the area of 81.25 to 81.40 while the previous top 80.12 would act as support. Global oil benchmark Brent crude futures rose 0.36 per cent to USD 90.15 per barrel.On the domestic equity market front, the 30-share BSE Sensex dropped 337.06 points or 0.57 per cent to end at 59,119.72, while the broader NSE Nifty fell 88.55 points or 0.5 per cent to 17,629.80.Foreign institutional investors were net sellers in the capital market on Wednesday as they offloaded shares worth Rs 461.04 crore, as per exchange data.",

    "content": "Dozens of women from Afghanistan's minority Hazara community protested in the capital Saturday after a suicide bombing a day earlier killed 20 people -- mostly young women from the ethnic group.A bomber blew himself up on Friday at a Kabul study hall as hundreds of pupils were taking tests in preparation for university entrance exams in the city's Dasht-e-Barchi area.The western neighbourhood is a predominantly Shiite Muslim enclave and home to the minority Hazara community -- a historically oppressed group that has been targeted in some of Afghanistan's most brutal attacks in recent years.Police said at least 20 people were killed but the United Nations has put the number at 24.On Saturday about 50 women chanted, \"Stop Hazara genocide, it's not a crime to be a Shiite\", as they marched past a hospital in Dasht-e-Barchi where several victims of the attack were being treated.Dressed in black hijabs and headscarves, angry protesters carried banners that read: \"Stop killing Hazaras\", an AFP correspondent reported.Witnesses have told AFP that the suicide attacker detonated in the women's section of the gender-segregated hall.\"Yesterday's attack was against the Hazaras and Hazara girls,\" protester Farzana Ahmadi, 19, told AFP.\"We demand a stop to this genocide. We staged the protest to demand our rights.\"Protesters later gathered in front of the hospital and chanted slogans as dozens of heavily armed Taliban, some carrying rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, kept watch.Since the hardline Taliban returned to power last August, women's protests have become risky, with numerous demonstrators detained and rallies broken up by Taliban forces firing shots in the air.No group has claimed responsibility for Friday's attack at the Kaaj Higher Educational Centre.But the jihadist Islamic State (IS) group regards Shiites as heretics and has previously claimed attacks in the area targeting girls, schools and mosques.The Taliban also regard the Hazara community as heathens, and rights groups often accused the Islamists of targeting them during their 20-year insurgency against the former US-backed government.Since returning to office the Taliban have pledged to protect minorities and clamp down on security threats.However, rights group Amnesty International said Friday's attack was \"a shamefaced reminder of the inaptitude and utter failure of the Taliban, as de-facto authorities, to protect the people of Afghanistan\".In May last year, before the Taliban's return to power, at least 85 people -- mainly girls -- were killed and about 300 were wounded when three bombs exploded near their school in Dasht-e-Barchi.No group again claimed responsibility, but a year earlier IS claimed a suicide attack on an educational centre in the same area that killed 24.IS has emerged as a key security challenge for the Taliban, but officials claim their forces have defeated the jihadists.",

    "content": "Haiti\u2019s government on Sunday announced that at least eight people have died from cholera, raising concerns about a potentially fast-spreading scenario and reviving memories of an epidemic that killed nearly 10,000 people a decade ago.The cases - the first cholera deaths reported in three years - came in a community called Dekayet in southern Port-au-Prince and in the gang-controlled seaside slum of Cite de Soleil, where thousands of people live in cramped, unsanitary conditions.\u201cCholera is something that can spread very, very quickly,\u201d warned Laure Adrien, director general of Haiti\u2019s health ministry.Food or water contaminated with the cholera bacteria can lead to severe diarrhea and dehydration that can be deadly.The United Nations said in a statement that it is working with Haiti\u2019s government to \u201cmount an emergency response to this potential outbreak,\u201d stressing that health teams need to be guaranteed safe access to areas where cases have been reported.The deaths come as a lack of fuel and ongoing protests shut down the availability of basic services across Haiti, including medical care and clean water, which is key to helping fight cholera and keep patients alive.Haiti\u2019s most powerful gang continues to control the entrance to a main fuel terminal in the capital of Port-au-Prince, leading to a lack of fuel amid soaring prices that have unleashed widespread protests that have paralyzed the country for more than two weeks.The absence of fuel and increasing number of roadblocks have prevented water trucks from visiting neighborhoods to provide potable water to those who can afford it. It also has prompted some companies to temporarily shut down operations.On Sunday, Caribbean Bottling Company said it could no longer produce or distribute potable water because its diesel reserves were \u201ccompletely depleted,\u201d adding that the lack of such a vital resource would affect \u201call sectors of society.\u201dAdrien said health officials were trying to visit communities where cholera has been reported, but that his agency, too, has been affected by a lack of fuel as he called on people blocking the gas terminal and organizing protests to \u201chave a conscience.\u201d\u201cThis is a real problem,\u201d he said of how the country has virtually been paralyzed. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this will not spread.\u201dAdrien noted that all those who died were unable to reach a hospital in time.Haiti Health Minister Alex Larsen said people have a right to protest but asked Haitians to allow potable water supplies into neighborhoods that have been cut off by roadblocks and protests.\u201cWater has not been in these areas for a long time, and people are not drinking treated water,\u201d he said, adding that cholera cases could spike again. \u201cWe ask people who can afford it to add a little chlorine to the water.\u201dHaiti\u2019s last cholera epidemic sickened more than 850,000 people in a country of more than 11 million, marking one of the world\u2019s worst outbreaks of the preventable disease in recent history.United Nations peacekeepers from Nepal were blamed for introducing cholera into Haiti\u2019s largest river in October 2010 by sewage. The U.N. has since acknowledged it played a role in the epidemic and that is has not done enough to help fight it, but it has not specifically said it introduced the disease.Haiti would have been declared cholera-free by the World Health Organization only after reaching three consecutive years with no new cases.",

Now they're testifying to the investigators.\"Governor Synegubov's spokeswoman told AFP the site of the killings was still unsafe for investigators, being a short distance from the still active frontline between Ukrainian and Russian forces.On Friday, AFP reporters counted the bodies of at least 11 civilians in the wrecked cars, some burned beyond recognition.Ukrainian troops operating nearby said they had found the dead on an exposed section of road alongside a rail track, as defeated Russian forces retreated from the area.Bullet holesOn Friday the bodies remained where they had died in and around the vehicles on a road running southeast from Kyrylivka 70 kilometres (43 miles) east of Kharkiv, in the direction of the Russian retreat.A small van or minibus was completely burnt out, with the carbonised remains of four people within. At least one of these corpses appeared small enough to have been a child.\"The vehicles were moving all together as a civilian convoy. We can see that there is almost no distance between the vehicles,\" said \"Filya\", a Ukrainian soldier who guided AFP to the scene.\"And obviously they were attacked by gunfire because you can see the bullet holes ...

Many of the victims were trampled or choked to death, authorities said.Indonesia: 129 killed, several injured in stampede at a football match after riot #ITVideo #Indonesia #EastJava pic.twitter.com/X0Kgru8PCZAt least 17 children were killed in the deadly crush while trying to escape the overpacked football stadium as police fired tear gas to disperse the spectators running amok.\"Seventeen children died and seven were treated, but there is a possibility that could increase,\" said Nahar, a ministry official.\"My family and I didn't think it would turn out like this,\" Endah Wahyuni told Reuters. She is the elder sister of two boys, 15-year-old Ahmad Cahyo and 14-year-old Muhammad Farel , who died after being caught in the melee.\"They loved soccer, but never watched Arema live at Kanjuruhan stadium, this was their first time,\" she added at her brothers' funeral on Sunday, referring to the home side they backed.Persebaya Surabaya defeated Arema FC 3-2 in Saturday night\u2019s match in East Java\u2019s province Malang city. Police said there were some 42,000 spectators in the stadium, all of whom were Arema\u2019s supporters because the organiser had banned Persebaya fans in an effort to avoid brawls.But a disappointing loss by Arema prompted angry spectators to pour into the field after the match to demand answers. Fans threw bottles and other objects at players and soccer officials and violence spread outside the stadium.At least five police cars were toppled and set ablaze and others damaged. Riot police first tried to force fans back into the stands, before lobbing tear gas shells, which is banned at soccer stadiums by Fifa. This sparked panic.Hundreds of spectators rushed to an exit gate to avoid the tear gas, resulting in a crush that trampled or suffocated 34 to death almost instantly, with many more deaths to follow due to injuries.Indonesian President Joko Widodo has expressed his deepest regret and ordered a thorough investigation into the deaths. He has also ordered the premier soccer league suspended until a safety reevaluation is carried out and tighter security put in place.Police and sport officials have been sent to Malang city to investigate the incident that ranks among the world's deadliest stadium disasters.Indonesia\u2019s soccer association has also banned Arema from hosting soccer matches for the remainder of the season.(With inputs from Agencies)",

The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission intentionally crashed on an asteroid to test a unique defence technology.Nasa is crashing the probe into the binary asteroid system Didymos to test a kinetic impactor technology that could be used in future to save Earth from an incoming asteroid. The spacecraft hit Deimorpos, a moonlet of the Didymos asteroid system, at 24,000 kilometres per hour to slightly change its orbit.The impact should be just enough to nudge the asteroid into a slightly tighter orbit around its companion space rock \u2014 demonstrating that if a killer asteroid ever heads our way, we\u2019d stand a fighting chance of diverting it.Also Read | Meet Dart, a space probe that will bang into an asteroid this MondayCameras and telescopes including the James Webb Space Telescope and the Hubble telescope are tracking the spacecraft, keeping an eye on the asteroid to see the impact.Dimorphos, about 9.6 million kilometres from Earth, is actually the sidekick of a 2,500-foot asteroid named Didymos, Greek for twin. Discovered in 1996, Didymos is spinning so fast that scientists believe it flung off material that eventually formed a moonlet. Dimorphos \u2014 roughly 525 feet across \u2014 orbits its parent body at a distance of 1.2 kilometres.Watch LIVE | Jupiter comes closest to Earth in 59 yearsThe Dart probe has a single instrument: a camera used for navigating, targeting and chronicling the final action. Believed to be essentially a rubble pile, Dimorphos will emerge as a point of light an hour before impact, looming larger and larger in the camera images beamed back to Earth.Although the strike itself should be immediately apparent, it could take a few weeks or more to verify the moonlet\u2019s tweaked orbit.Also Read | King Tut hides ancient Egyptian secret, location of Queen Nefertiti's tomb",

    "content": "Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina faced a massive cleanup on Saturday from the destruction wrought by Hurricane Ian, after one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the US mainland caused tens of billions of dollars in damage and killed dozens.New images from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) showed several beach cottages and a motel building that lined the shores of Florida's Sanibel Island had been wiped away by Ian's storm surge. Even though most homes were still standing, they appeared to have roof damage, the images showed.Ian, now a post-tropical cyclone, continued to weaken on Saturday but was still forecast to bring treacherous conditions to parts of the Central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic, according to the National Hurricane Center, which added that flood watches were in effect across southwestern Virginia and southern West Virginia.\"Major to record river flooding will continue across central Florida through next week. Limited flash, urban and small stream flooding is possible across the central Appalachians and the southern Mid-Atlantic this weekend, with minor river flooding expected over the coastal Carolinas,\" the center said.South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster told reporters on Saturday there were no storm-related deaths in the state and that most electricity had been restored. However, he added: \"We know we have much cleaning up and rebuilding to do.\"The storm struck Florida's Gulf Coast on Wednesday, turning beach towns into disaster areas. On Friday, it pummeled waterfront Georgetown, South Carolina, north of the historic city of Charleston, with wind speeds of 85 miles (140 km) per hour.Roads were flooded and blocked by trees while a number of piers were damaged.About 1.5 million homes and businesses were without power in the Carolinas, Virginia and Florida at 1 p.m. ET (1700 GMT) on Saturday, according to website PowerOutage.us. About 1.2 million of those outages were in Florida.Both the number of casualties and repair costs remained unclear, but the extent of the damage was becoming apparent as Florida entered its third day after Ian first hit.There were at least 35 deaths in Florida's Lee County alone that were attributable to the hurricane, the county sheriff's office said in a Facebook Post on Saturday morning. Many of the dead across Florida were elderly people, including a 92-year-old man, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said earlier.In North Carolina, four people died in storm-related incidents, state officials said on Saturday.Thousands of people were still unaccounted for in Florida, officials said, but many of them were likely in shelters or without power.\"We suffered more flood damage than wind damage,\" Governor Ron DeSantis said Saturday. \"That is going to require a lot of flood claims being filed.\"Insurers braced for a hit of between $28 billion and $47 billion, in what could be the costliest Florida storm since Hurricane Andrew in 1992, according to U.S. property data and analytics company CoreLogic.President Joe Biden has approved a disaster declaration, making federal resources available to counties affected by the storm. The president said Ian was \"likely to rank among the worst (storms) ... in the nation's history.\" On Saturday, he declared an emergency in North Carolina.'DEVASTATING'The Florida city of Fort Myers, close to where the eye of the storm first came ashore, absorbed a major blow, with numerous houses destroyed.Offshore, Sanibel Island, a popular destination for vacationers and retirees, was cut off when a causeway was rendered impassable.Ricky Anderson, 57, a cashier who lived on Sanibel Island, said he \"lost everything in the hurricane,\" including his life savings and asked the government for help. Anderson said he only recently moved to Sanibel Island from Illinois in June.\"Where are all those people supposed to go that have no home anymore?\" Anderson said.Robert Hartman, 81, who has lived in Fort Myers for 50 years, said he needed the government's help in the cleanup and repair of his residence from the damage caused by the storm. \"We have no power, no phone service, nothing. We would just like a little help to get my home back in shape because I have nowhere to go,\" he added, his voice choking.At a mobile home park on San Carlos Island in Fort Myers Beach, the wind and water pushed trailers together. A boat lay on its side at a local marina, where another boat had come to rest in a tree.Hundreds of miles north in Georgetown, residents were also trying to put their lives back together.With a population of about 10,000, the town is a tourist destination known for its oak tree-lined streets and more than 50 sites on the National Registry of Historic Places. It was heavily damaged by Hurricane Hugo in 1989.",

England clawed their way back and the visitors were able to post 209 runs in their 20 overs on the back of Dawid Malan's 78 and cameos from Ben Duckett and Harry Brook in the final match. In response, the Pakistan batters, apart from Shan Masood, failed to make an impression.The hosts lost skipper Babar Azam and Mohammed Rizwan early and Masood was the only one who offered some resistance. Ultimately, their innings folded at 142 for 8, handing the trophy to England.Speaking at the post-match presentation, Ali said that it was a brilliant game for the team and had special praise reserved for the bowling unit and said they performed well throughout the series.The stand-in skipper also praised the batting performance in the final match and said that it gives a lot of confidence moving forward.Ali further commented that it was amazing to see how the team responded in two must-win games and also hailed the squad depth of England.The all-rounder ended by thanking the Pakistan Cricket Board for looking after the team during the series.\"Brilliant game from us, we played well from the start. I thought our bowling was outstanding, throughout the series we bowled really well. When the team is batting like that, it gives a lot of confidence. Credit to the boys for the way they played. We needed two must-win games. It was amazing to see how we won the last two games. Also shows the depth we have in our squad.

    "content": "After being encircled by Ukrainian forces, Russia pulled troops out Saturday from an eastern Ukrainian city that it had been using as a front-line hub. It was the latest victory for the Ukrainian counteroffensive that has humiliated and angered the Kremlin.Russia\u2019s withdrawal from Lyman complicates its internationally vilified declaration just a day earlier that it had annexed four regions of Ukraine \u2014 an area that includes Lyman. Taking the city paves the way for Ukrainian troops to potentially push further into land that Moscow now illegally claims as its own.\u201cThe Ukrainian flag is already in Lyman, Donetsk region. Fighting is still going on there. But there is no trace of any pseudo-referendum there,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly address Saturday.He was referring to \u201creferendums\u201d that Russia held at gunpoint in the four regions before annexing them \u2014 Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.The fighting comes at a pivotal moment in Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war. Facing Ukrainian gains on the battlefield \u2014 which he frames as a U.S.-orchestrated effort to destroy Russia \u2014 Putin this week heightened threats of nuclear force and used his most aggressive, anti-Western rhetoric to date.Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry claimed to have inflicted damage on Ukrainian forces in battling to hold Lyman, but said outnumbered Russian troops were withdrawn to more favorable positions. Ukrainian forces moved into the city, and Zelenskyy\u2019s chief of staff posted photos of a Ukrainian flag being hoisted on the town\u2019s outskirts.Lyman had been an important link in the Russian front line for ground communications and logistics. Located 160 kilometers (100 miles) southeast of Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, it\u2019s in the Donetsk region near the border with Luhansk, two regions that Russia annexed Friday.Ukrainian forces have retaken vast swaths of territory in a counteroffensive that started in September. They have pushed Russian forces out of the Kharkiv area and moved east across the Oskil River.Moscow\u2019s withdrawal from Lyman prompted immediate criticism from some Russian officials. The leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, blamed the retreat, without evidence, on one Russian general being \u201ccovered up for by higher-up leaders in the General Staff.\u201d He called for \u201cmore drastic measures.\u201dMeanwhile, on the Russian-annexed Crimean Peninsula, the governor of the city of Sevastopol announced an emergency situation at an airfield there. Explosions and huge billows of smoke could be seen by beachgoers in the Russian-held resort. Authorities said a plane rolled off the runway at the Belbek airfield, and said ammunition on board had caught fire.Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 in violation of international law.Russian bombardment has intensified in recent days as Moscow moved swiftly with its latest annexation and ordered a mass mobilization at home to bolster its forces. The Russian call-up has proven unpopular at home, prompting tens of thousands of Russian men to flee the country.Zelenskyy and his military have vowed to keep fighting to liberate the regions that Putin claimed to have annexed Friday, and other Russian-occupied areas.Ukrainian authorities accused Russian forces of targeting two humanitarian convoys in recent days, killing dozens of civilians.The governor of the Kharkiv region, Oleh Syniehubov, said 24 civilians were killed in an attack this week on a convoy trying to flee the Kupiansk district. He called it \u201cruelty that can\u2019t be justified.\u201d He said 13 children and a pregnant woman were among the dead.\u201cThe Russians fired at civilians almost at point-blank range,\u201d Syniehubov wrote on Telegram.The Security Service of Ukraine, the secret police force known by the acronym SBU, posted photographs of the attacked convoy. At least one truck appeared to have been blown up, with burned corpses in what remained of its truck bed. Another vehicle at the front of the convoy was torched. Bodies lay on the side of the road or still inside vehicles that were pockmarked with bullet holes.Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said its rockets destroyed Ukrainian military targets in the area but has not commented on accusations that it targeted fleeing civilians. Russian troops have retreated from much of the Kharkiv region but continue to shell the area.And a Russian strike in the Zaporizhzhia region\u2019s capital killed 31 people and wounded 88, Ukrainian officials said. The British Defense Ministry said the Russians \u201calmost certainly\u201d struck a humanitarian convoy there with S-300 anti-aircraft missiles. Russian-installed officials in Zaporizhzhia blamed Ukrainian forces but gave no evidence.In other developments, in an apparent attempt to secure Moscow\u2019s hold on the newly annexed territory, Russian forces seized the director-general of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Ihor Murashov, on Friday, according to the Ukrainian state nuclear company Energoatom.Energoatom said Russian troops stopped Murashov\u2019s car, blindfolded him and took him to an undisclosed location.Russia did not comment on the report. The International Atomic Energy Agency said Russia told it that \u201cthe director-general of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was temporarily detained to answer questions.\u201dThe Vienna-based IAEA said it \u201chas been actively seeking clarifications and hopes for a prompt and satisfactory resolution of this matter.\u201dThe power plant has been caught in the crossfire of the war. Ukrainian technicians continued running it after Russian troops seized the power station, and its last reactor was shut down in September as a precautionary measure amid ongoing shelling nearby.In other fighting reported Saturday, four people were killed by Russian shelling Friday in the Donetsk region, governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said. The Russian army struck the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv twice overnight, once with drones and the second time with missiles, according to the regional governor.Russia now claims sovereignty over 15% of Ukraine in what NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called \u201cthe largest attempted annexation of European territory by force since the Second World War.\u201dZelenskyy on Friday formally applied for NATO membership, upping the pressure on Western allies to defend Ukraine.In Washington, President Joe Biden signed a bill that provides another infusion \u2014 more than $12.3 billion \u2014 in military and economic aid linked to the war in Ukraine.",

Here\u2019s a look at how the chaos occurred and what is being done to prevent future incidents:Chaos broke out after Persebaya Surabaya defeated Arema Malang 3-2 in Saturday night\u2019s match in East Java\u2019s province Malang city. Police said there were some 42,000 spectators in the stadium, all of whom were Arema\u2019s supporters because the organizer had banned Persebaya fans in an effort to avoid brawls.But a disappointing loss by Arema \u2014 the first match lost to Persebaya at its home stadium \u2014 prompted angry spectators to pour into the field after the match to demand answers. Fans threw bottles and other objects at players and soccer officials and violence spread outside the stadium, where at least five police cars were toppled and set ablaze and others damaged. Riot police responded with tear gas, which is banned at soccer stadiums by FIFA. But it sparked panic.Hundreds of spectators rushed to an exit gate to avoid the tear gas, resulting in a crush that trampled or suffocated 34 to death almost instantly, with many more deaths to follow due to injuries.In one of the worst sports disasters, police said at least 125 people died, including children and two police officers, most of whom were trampled.More than 100 people were injured. Police said the death toll is likely to rise more with multiple people in critical condition.Data from an Indonesian football watchdog organization, Save Our Soccer, said that at least 86 soccer fans had died since 1995, most of them in fights.ALSO READ| 174 killed, several injured in stampede at football match after riot in IndonesiaFootball is the most popular sport in Indonesia and the domestic league is widely followed. Fans are strongly attached to their clubs, and such fanaticism often ends in violence and hooliganism. But it usually happens outside the stadium.The most well-known feud is between Persija Jakarta and Persib Bandung. Supporters of the two clubs have clashed in several matches that led to deaths. In 2018, a Persija Jakarta supporter was beaten to death by Persib Bandung rivals.Indonesian football has also been beset with trouble on the international stage. Brawls broke out between supporters of archrivals Indonesia and Malaysia in 2019 during qualifiers for this year\u2019s FIFA World Cup. In September 2019, Malaysian fans were threatened and pelted with projectiles at a World Cup qualifier in Jakarta, and Malaysia\u2019s visiting sports minister had to be evacuated from the stadium after violence broke out. Two months later, fans hurled flares and bottles at each other in another match in Kuala Lumpur.ALSO READ| Wayne Rooney 'deeply shocked' by Indonesia football stampede disaster: Thoughts are with everyone affectedAlso in 2019, after losing in the finals of the U-22 match to Vietnam in the Southeast Asian Games, Indonesian fans took to social media to insult, harass, and send death threats to Vietnamese players and even their families.In June, two Persib Bandung fans died while jostling to enter the stadium in Bandung to watch the 2022 President\u2019s Cup. The angry supporters became aggressive because the officers on the field did not allow them to enter the already-full stadium.Indonesian President Joko Widodo has expressed his deepest regret and ordered a thorough investigation into the deaths. He has also ordered the premier soccer league suspended until a safety reevaluation is carried out and tighter security put in place. Widodo said he hoped \u201cthis tragedy will be the last tragedy of football in Indonesia.\u201dIndonesia\u2019s soccer association has also banned Arema from hosting soccer matches for the remainder of the season. Rights group Amnesty International urged Indonesia to investigate the use of tear gas at the stadium and ensure that those found in violations are tried in open court.ALSO READ| Football world mourns Indonesia tragedy",

    "content": "The ruptures on the Nord Stream natural gas pipeline system under the Baltic Sea have led to what is likely the biggest single release of climate-damaging methane ever recorded, the United Nations Environment Programme said on Friday.A huge plume of highly concentrated methane, a greenhouse gas far more potent but shorter-lived than carbon dioxide, was detected in an analysis this week of satellite imagery by researchers associated with UNEP's International Methane Emissions Observatory, or IMEO, the organization said.\u201cThis is really bad, most likely the largest emission event ever detected,\" Manfredi Caltagirone, head of the IMEO for UNEP, told Reuters. \u201cThis is not helpful in a moment when we absolutely need to reduce emissions.\u201dResearchers at GHGSat, which uses satellites to monitor methane emissions, estimated the leak rate from one of four rupture points was 22,920 kilograms per hour. That is equivalent to burning about 630,000 pounds of coal every hour, GHGSat said in a statement.\"This rate is very high, especially considering it's four days following the initial breach,\" the company said.The total amount of methane leaking from the Gazprom-led pipeline system may be higher than from a major leak that occurred in December from offshore oil and gas fields in Mexican waters of the Gulf of Mexico, which spilled around 100 metric tons of methane per hour, Caltagirone said.The Gulf of Mexico leak, also viewable from space, ultimately released around 40,000 metric tons of methane over 17 days, according to a study conducted by the Polytechnic University of Valencia and published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters.That is the equivalent of burning 1.1 billion pounds of coal, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator.Improved satellite technology has rapidly enhanced the ability of scientists to find and analyze greenhouse gas emissions in recent years, something some governments hope will help companies detect and prevent methane emissions.The major leaks that suddenly erupted in the Nord Stream gas pipelines that run from Russia to Europe have generated plenty of theories but few clear answers about who or what caused the damage. Both Russia and the European Union have suggested the ruptures were caused by saboteurs.Europe and the United States have heaped sanctions on Moscow in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine, raising worries the Kremlin will seek to deprive Europe of crucial energy supplies leading into the winter.Caltagirone said, whatever the cause, the damage to the pipeline posed a problem beyond energy security. \u201cThis is the most wasteful way to generate emissions,\u201d he said.",

Wipro chairman Rishad Premji said that the company found 300 people to be moonlightning and working for rival companies in the last few months, adding that there was no place for such people in the company.WHAT IS MOONLIGHTING?Moonlighting means taking up a second job or multiple other work assignments apart from one\u2019s full-time job. The practice of working for other organisation while committing oneself to one\u2019s primary workplace, typically without the employer's knowledge, is termed as 'moonlighting'. Companies have opposed the practice, saying that employees doing multiple jobs can impact their productivity.Moonlighting has become a topic of debate in the IT industry as working from home became the normal norm during the Covid-19 pandemic, which is believed to have led to a rise in dual employment.Moonlighting has somewhat divided the Indian IT firm following Wipro's chief's remarks. Tata Consultancy Services' chief operating officer (CFO) NG Subramaniam has termed it an ethical issue, while Tech Mahindra CEO CP Gurnani said he could be open to the practice if it helps employees make extra money. He also hopes employees to be open and has warned them of committing fraud.ALSO READ| Wipro chief Rishad Premji fires 300 employees for secretly working for competitors, says moonlighting is unethicalAnother major IT firm, Infosys, has warned its employees against taking up a second job without letting the company know. In one of the recent emails sent by the HR department to employees, Infosys highlighted that all its employees must read their employment contracts before taking up an alternative job. In fact, the company also warned employees of termination if they take up a second job during or post-working hours.The majority of the IT companies have hardened its stand against moonlighting and have warned its employees of termination if found to be holding dual employment.If a contract of an employee calls for non-compete and single employment, then moonlighting could be considered as cheating.Speaking at an All India Management Association event and as reported by Moneycontrol, Premji said, \"If you actually look at the definition of moonlighting, it is having a second job secretively I'm all about transparency. As a part of transparency, individuals in organisations can have very candid conversations.\"He added that organisations and individuals could make a \"concerted choice\" about second jobs. Alluding to the Wipro incident, he reiterated that current employees working for rival firms are a \"complete violation of integrity in its deepest form\".(With agency inputs)ALSO READ| Infosys may fire employees caught moonlighting, asks everyone to read employment contract",

    "content": "Tutankhamun, the ancient Egyptian King, hides more secrets than previously thought.A British Egyptologist now claims that the tomb of Tutankhamun, discovered about 100 years ago in 1922, has clues that could support the age-old theory that Egyptian queen Nefertiti lies in a hidden chamber next to her stepson. While the theory is yet to be proven, there are new clues supporting it.In a report published in The Guardian, Egyptologists claim drawings showing Tutankhamun being buried by his pharaonic successor, Ay, painted over drawings of Tutankhamun burying Nefertiti. The later drawings, reportedly, show them performing the ritual of \u201copening the mouth\u201d of the mummy, to restore the deceased\u2019s five senses.\u201cI can now show that, under the cartouches of Ay, are cartouches of Tutankhamun himself, proving that that scene originally showed Tutankhamun burying his predecessor, Nefertiti. You would not have had that decoration in the tomb of Tutankhamun,\u201d Nicholas Reeves, a former curator in the British Museum\u2019s Department of Egyptian Antiquities, told The Guardian.Also Read | Jupiter closest to Earth tonight: Next time it happens even your children won't be hereNefertiti was the principal wife of Akhenaten and stepmother of Tutankhamun. Her burial tomb has never been found and archeologists across the world, who are interested in ancient Egyptian civilization, have long been interested in finding it.Reeves further said, \"Close inspection of Ay\u2019s cartouches reveals clear, underlying traces of an earlier name, that of Tutankhamun. In its original version, this scene had shown Tutankhamun performing the funerary ritual for the tomb\u2019s original owner, his immediate predecessor Nefertiti.\u201dWhen discovered, Tutankhamun's tomb had chairs and chariots, treasures, and other luxuries he would need in the afterlife, when he died unexpectedly at the age of just 19 years. Reeves claimed that Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb is merely the outer section of a much larger tomb \u201cprepared for and still occupied by\u201d Nefertiti.Also Read | Black hole at center of our galaxy is not alone\u201cIt\u2019s very easy just to write this off as sheer fantasy, but I\u2019ve discovered that the decoration of the wall in the burial chamber had been changed. We\u2019ve always been puzzled by Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb because of its strange shape. It\u2019s very small, and not what we\u2019d expect of a king,\u201d he added.Archeologists have been conducting genetic tests since 2007 to find the lost queen and have so far tested 16 royal mummies. While they have been identified as Tut's grandparents, his parents, and his wife, there is no evidence of his stepmother as the search continues.Also Read | Nasa's $300 million Dart probe to crash on asteroid tonight: When, how to watch collision",

The crop would earn him enough so that, as he puts it, his family of five wouldn\u2019t be reduced to begging. Then came the deluge.Pakistan\u2019s massive floods this summer collapsed Mohammed\u2019s home and destroyed his four acres of cotton, wiping out most of his income.On top of that, his land and that of his neighbors remain underwater, three months after the heaviest rains stopped. Like many farmers across southern Pakistan, he may not be able to plant his next crop \u2014 wheat \u2014 in time.That could spell trouble for the country\u2019s food supply.\u201cThese rains have destroyed everything for us,\u201d said Mohammed, who lives in a tent with his wife and children near his wrecked house in Khairpur, one of the country\u2019s hardest-hit districts. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have anything to eat.\u201dThis summer\u2019s flooding, caused by monsoon rains nearly triple the usual ferocity, wiped out huge swaths of crops, leaving already impoverished families struggling to obtain food. Farmers and officials warn that Pakistan could now face serious food shortages at a time when the government is strapped for cash and world food prices are high.Also Read | Pakistan floods claim 1290 lives displace over 6.3 lakhsNearly 15% of Pakistan\u2019s rice crop and 40% of its cotton crop were lost, according to officials. The waters also wiped out the personal grain stores that many farming families rely on for food yearlong.The flooding, blamed in part on climate change, killed nearly 1,600 people, damaged nearly 2 million homes and overall wreaked damage estimated at more than $30 billion.At the United Nations last week, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif told The Associated Press that crops on 4 million acres were washed away. \u201cWe need funds to provide livelihood to our people. We need funds to compensate for the loss of crops to our people, to our farmers.\u201dThe government says there is no immediate worry about food supplies. In a statement to the AP, the state disaster agency said wheat stock are enough to last through the next harvest and that the government is importing more.However, the upcoming wheat crop has been thrown into uncertainty. Planting usually starts in October. In Punjab province, the country\u2019s main wheat producer, fields suffered less damage and can be sown in time. But in southern Sindh province, the second largest producer, some 50% of the fields remain underwater, according to Jam Khan Shoro, a provincial irrigation minister in Sindh.Also Read | Biblical floods submerge Pakistan, overflowing Indus Aerial footage in Sindh shows field after field still inundated. The province, in Pakistan\u2019s southern lowlands at the downstream end of its major rivers, is where the floods hit hardest: 80% of the rice crop and 70% of cotton were destroyed, devastating the livelihoods of the small farmers who make up most the production.Altaf Hussain Marri, a larger and relatively well-off landholder in Khairpur, said he normally gives away wheat as a gift to friends and family. Now he\u2019s worried about having enough for himself and his children, unsure if his 400 inundated acres will drain in time. The floods demolished his cotton and rice crops, worth around $40,000.\u201cIf we fail to grow wheat ... next year we might not have even wheat to eat,\u201d Marri said. \u201cIt will create food insecurity in the country. The poor will suffer a lot. There will be no flour.\u201dPakistan\u2019s agricultural sector had been growing in recent years, allowing the country to export some wheat and rice.\u201cNow we will have to import wheat and other food items,\u201d Pakistan\u2019s Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal told the AP.Sharif, the prime minister, said Pakistan may have to import about a million metric tons of wheat, and it could come from Russia, but Pakistan is open to other offers if the price is right.Pakistan has already put out orders to import 500,000 metric tons of wheat, Planning Ministry officials say. There are contingency plans to buy as much 2.5 million tons over the next year, but officials are waiting to see how much wheat is planted, they said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the policy was not yet set.Ashfaq Ahmad, a senior economist, said the additional wheat needs to be brought in quickly, by next month.Otherwise, \u201cI am seeing a food crisis in December,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cAny delay in the import of wheat will cause food shortage.\u201dThe flooding was also a blow to Pakistan\u2019s important cash crops. Losses will mean lower exports of rice, which earned $2 billion in 2020. Cotton losses could hurt the country\u2019s biggest export, textiles and clothes, which brought in more than $20 billion annually in recent years.But the greater damage and danger is likely to Pakistan\u2019s poor, with no margin to endure losses in income and food.In Dasht, a remote district of Baluchistan province, hundreds of orchard owners worry about their future after losing crops of grapes, apples and other fruits. In parts of Baluchistan, piles upon piles of rotten apples can be seen in submerged areas.Even before the floods, some 38 million Pakistanis, more than 16% of the population, were living in moderate or severe food insecurity, meaning they were uncertain about being able to obtain food or at times have outright gone without eating, according to the World Health Organization. Nearly 18% of children were acutely malnourished.Also Read | Why did Pakistan experience deadly floods? Climate changeThe blow to the food supply and incomes will tip those populations deeper into hunger, U.N. agencies have warned. The U.N.\u2019s World Food Program has so far delivered food to 600,000 flood survivors.Iqbal, the planning minister, said Sindh province is the country\u2019s biggest producer of vegetables for domestic markets. Those crops were lost, along with families\u2019 personal stores of grains for themselves and feed for their livestock.\u201cSo, therefore we have a real food security challenge at hand,\u201d he said.On the ground in Sukkur, another hard-hit district neighboring Khairpur, the local agricultural director Rasool Bux Junejo fears the worst. Farmers won\u2019t be able to grow wheat or other key crops like sunflowers and mustard.\u201cThat will be a huge loss in the coming months. If you ask me as an agriculture worker, I foresee famine, God forbid,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be unable to provide food to our people.\u201dAlso Read | Explained: Pakistan fatal flooding has hallmarks of global warming",

    "content": "Ukrainian forces reached the entrance of the eastern bastion of Lyman on Saturday after encircling thousands of Russian troops, Kyiv said, in a battlefield rebuttal to the Kremlin a day after it proclaimed a swathe of territory to be part of Russia.The capture of Lyman would be a major setback for Russia after President Vladimir Putin proclaimed the annexation of Donetsk region, along with three other regions, at a ceremony in Moscow on Friday condemned by Kyiv and the West as a farce.\"The Russian grouping in the area of Lyman is surrounded,\" the spokesperson, Serhii Cherevatyi, said on television.The Russian Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Russia's last operational update was on Friday evening. On Saturday, the ministry's Telegram channel published a series of congratulatory messages, including one from Putin, to mark an army holiday, Ground Forces Day.Russia has used Lyman as a logistics and transport hub for its operations in the north of the Donetsk region. Its fall would be Ukraine's biggest battlefield gain since a lightning counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region last month.The Ukrainian military spokesperson said the capture of Lyman would allow Kyiv to advance into the Luhansk region, whose full capture Moscow announced at the beginning of July after weeks of slow, grinding advances.\"Lyman is important because it is the next step towards the liberation of the Ukrainian Donbas. It is an opportunity to go further to Kreminna and Sievierodonetsk, and it is psychologically very important,\" he said.Donetsk and Luhansk regions together make up the wider Donbas region that has been a major focus for Russia since soon after the start of Moscow's invasion on Feb. 24.Cherevatyi said the operation around Lyman is still under way and Russian troops are mounting unsuccessful attempts to break out of the encirclement.\"Some are surrendering, they have a lot of killed and wounded, but the operation is not yet over,\" he said.Ukraine's exiled governor of Luhansk said Russian forces had asked for a safe exit out of the encirclement, but Ukraine rejected the request.The Ukrainian General Staff told Reuters it had no such information.Putin proclaimed the Donbas regions of Donetsk and Luhansk and the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia to be Russian land in Friday's ceremony - a swathe of territory equal to about 18% of Ukraine's total surface land area.Ukraine and its Western allies branded Russia's move as illegal. Kyiv vowed to continue liberating its land of Russian forces and said it would not hold peace talks with Moscow while Putin remained as president.",

What makes this celestial event unmissable is the fact that it will not happen for another 107 years and, for most of us, we will not be able to see this unique planetary proximity again.The largest planet in the solar system will be just 59 crore kilometers from Earth on Monday as it reaches planetary opposition to the Sun. Jupiter's opposition is a location in its orbit, when the planet is completely opposite the Sun, making it brighter than usual in the night sky.\"Jupiter\u2019s opposition occurs every 13 months, making the planet appear larger and brighter than any other time of the year. But that\u2019s not all. Jupiter will also make its closest approach to Earth since 1963 almost six decades ago,\" Nasa said in a statement, adding that this happens because Earth and Jupiter do not orbit the Sun in perfect circles meaning the planets will pass each other at different distances throughout the year.According to the MP Birla Planetarium in Kolkata, Jupiter will appear bright with a 2.9 magnitude in the skies, giving it a much brighter and bigger appearance. The planet, which has 53 moons, will be in the skies through the night. Jupiter at its closest to Earth will appear in the skies after 5:29 pm today and will be visible till 5:31 am on September 27.Also Read | Jupiter closest to Earth tonight: Next time it happens even your children won't be hereJupiter will be visible throughout the country and people in almost every city will be able to see the bright object as it gets dark. The planet hasn't been this close to Earth since 1963 and will not come closer till 2129.While the largest planet will be visible to the naked eye, you can look at it using either binoculars or telescopes. The celestial viewing will be aided by the fact that with the new moon appearing on Sunday, the moon on Monday will be only 17 per cent illuminated, adding to the clear visibility of Jupiter.Try to find higher ground with open skies to watch Jupiter, and if you are watching using a telescope, make sure to have a stable mount. While a 60-90 mm telescope will be just fine to see the planet, a larger one is recommended if you want to see the planet's unique features like the Great Red Spot.Also Read | Moon playing hard to get: Nasa's Artemis-1 mission will not launch this month",

The policy tone indicates hawkish measures, suggesting elevated hikes, leading to the pull-out of FIIs money from the Indian equities.\"However, this trend is expected to be short-lived, as future inflation trend forecasts a clampdown, bringing stability in policy stance by the end of this year,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said markets are likely to remain range-bound ahead of US Fed interest rate decision to be announced on September 21 (Wednesday).\"While it is widely expected that Fed will go for at least 75 basis points hike, however given the stubbornness of US inflation and robust numbers from US data points like retail sales and a strong labour market, there is a high chance that the aggressive stance towards rate hike is likely to continue for a prolonged time.\"Even the Bank of England is likely to announce a 50 bps rate hike to combat inflation and could keep global markets under pressure,\" he noted.In the broader market, the BSE midcap gauge declined 0.16 per cent and the smallcap index dipped 0.17 per cent.The BSE FMCG index gained 0.98 per cent, while auto climbed 0.78 per cent, financial services 0.58 per cent, teck 0.43 per cent and energy 0.33 per cent.However, metal fell by 1.25 per cent, followed by realty (0.99 per cent) and power (0.52 per cent).Elsewhere in Asia, markets in Seoul, Shanghai and Hong Kong ended lower.European equity markets were also quoting in the negative territory in the afternoon session.

    "content": "Years after the great conjunction dazzled the skies above Earth with Jupiter and Saturn lining up perfectly, another celestial event is set to dazzle stargazers. Jupiter will be closest to Earth in 59 years tonight as it reaches planetary opposition. While Jupiter's planetary opposition happens every 13 months, this proximity to Earth is rare.Jupiter at its closest will be 59,06,29,248 kilometers from Earth, which on a cosmic scale is not that far. The last time it came this close was in 1963. The next time this rare event happens again will be about 107 years from now in 2129. None of us will be here to see that happen, making the opposition tonight unmissable.While Jupiter will be just over 59 crore kilometers from Earth at its closest, at its farthest, the planet is 96,56,06,400 kilometers away. With Jupiter approaching, the largest planet in the solar system will appear bigger and brighter in the skies seen above Earth.A planetary opposition is a unique phenomenon, which according to Nasa, happens when an astronomical object rises in the east as the Sun sets in the west, placing the object and the Sun on opposite sides of Earth.The planet, which takes over 11 years to complete one revolution around the Sun, will be exactly opposite to the Sun in its orbit and this unique arrangement makes it one of the brightest objects in the sky as seen from Earth.Also Read | Moon playing hard to get: Nasa's Artemis-1 mission will not launch this month\"Every 399 days, which is roughly every 13 months and four days, Jupiter comes in opposition to Earth and appears very bright in the night sky. This year Jupiter will be at Opposition on September 27th at 01:30 a.m. IST. Meanwhile, on January 21, 2023, it will be closest to the Sun known as perihelion point,\" Shilpi Gupta, Scientific Officer, M. P. Birla Institute of Fundamental Research, told indiatoday.in.She added that Jupiter will appear very bright at -2.9 magnitude, with a diameter of 49.9 arcsec in the constellation Pisces. The high brightness will make it visible to the naked eye and can be seen across the world.\"In fact, Jupiter will appear brightest in 59 years. It hadn\u2019t been so close since 8th October 1963 and it will not be so close until 7th October 2129. So, it is a must-see event for all enthusiasts,\" Shilpi Gupta added.Jupiter has always been a source of curiosity for scientists and astronomers looking for signs of life outside Earth. With a catlogue of 53 named Moon, the planet practically is a mini solar system in itself and its strong gravitational pull has saved Earth from countless asteroid impacts.Also Read | Black hole at center of our galaxy is not aloneNasa is already prepping a mission to explore Europa, one of Jupiter's massive moons, that is said to harbour more water than oceans on Earth and could be potentially habitable.

Recently, it suffered a major setback after a European Union(EU) court upheld the EU\u2019s antitrust fine of $4.12 billion.Google was fined for allegedly putting in place strategic restrictions on Android phone makers to ensure that its own search engine benefited alone.Indian authorities are also ramping up their probe against Google with Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the Minister of State for Electronics and IT( MEITY), spearheading the country\u2019s role and response in the global antitrust drive.The Indian government\u2019s antitrust watchdog, Competition Committee of India (CCI), is also proceeding on a petition against Google filed by the DNPA (Digital News Publishers Association). The DNPA is seeking a fair share in the distribution of advertisement revenue earned by Google on its digital platforms of news publishers.ALSO READ | Why India needs to strengthen data protection laws without stymieing industryLeading media organisations under DNPA have come together to call upon big tech giants such as Google to be fair in their relationship with domestic news providers and make revenue-sharing more transparent.A parliamentary committee has also been deliberating on various issues concerning the big tech monopolies.Google is likely to face multiple lawsuits in the US. The US Department of Justice approached a federal judge accusing Google of monopolistic behaviour. If the case goes to trial and Google is held guilty, big telecom companies could lose out on massive earnings.This comes after recent disclosures showed that Google allegedly pays Samsung, Apple, and other telecom giants billions of dollars to ensure the sole domination of its search engine.ALSO READ | Maharashtra cancels license of Johnson & Johnson baby powder over quality concernsMeanwhile, a group of 13 influential companies called upon the US Congress to green-light a proposed bill that could considerably shrink the powers of Google and other tech stalwarts.The White House also joined the initiative against big tech platforms and rolled out six principles aimed at reforming them. One of those principles listed by US President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is to drop the special protection and immunity that social media firms enjoy with regard to the platforms\u2019 handling of misinformation.Additionally, lawmakers in South Korea also slapped combined fines of $71 million on Alphabet and Meta for alleged privacy violations.

The newly discovered virus is believed to be competent at infecting human bodies and resistant to all the existing coronavirus vaccines. A team of researchers found that the proteins from the bat virus, identified as Khosta-2, can penetrate into the cells of humans.Following this, scientists called for universal vaccines that should be developed against the viruses found in the fauna.\"Our research further demonstrates the sarbecoviruses circulating in wildlife outside of Asia, even in places like western Russia where the Khosta-2 virus was found, also pose a threat to global health and ongoing vaccine campaigns against SARS-CoV-2,\" Mirror UK quoted a virologist from Washington as saying.\"Genetically, these weird Russian viruses looked like some of the others that had been discovered elsewhere around the world, but because they did not look like SARS-CoV-2, no one thought they were really anything to get excited about,\" the virus expert added.The Khosta-1 and Khosta-2 viruses were discovered in Russian bats in 2020. However, initial examination suggested that they were not a threat to human bodies. Later, tests showed Khosta-2 could not be neutralised by the serums and effects of current Covid vaccines.A team at Washington State University's Paul G Allen School found that the Khosta-2 can spike protein to infect human cells while being immune to monoclonal antibodies and existing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Also, antibodies in a person, who was infected with the Omicron strain, could not neutralise the virus.",

That conclusion was in a recent CDC report, and echoed Friday by Marc Lipsitch, director of science in the agency\u2019s disease-forecasting center.Lipsitch hesitated to say monkeypox is permanently here to stay, but he said it stands to be a continuing threat for the next few years.\u201cIt\u2019s in many geographic locations within the country\u201d as well as in other countries, Lipsitch told The Associated Press. \u201cThere\u2019s no clear path in our mind to complete elimination domestically.\u201dThe virus has mainly spread among gay and bisexual men, though health officials continue to stress that anyone can be infected. It\u2019s important that people at risk take steps to prevent spread and that vaccination efforts continue, Lipsitch said.ALSO READ| Over 30 children test positive for monkeypox in US, 9 cases in Texas aloneThe CDC report contained some good news: The U.S. outbreak seems to have peaked in early August. The average number of daily cases being reported \u2014 fewer than 150 \u2014 is about a third what it was reported in the middle of the summer, and officials expect the decline will continue for at least the next several weeks.Lipsitch attributed the good news to increasing vaccinations, cautious behavior by people at risk and infection-derived immunity in the highest risk populations.Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, agreed that it\u2019s unlikely that spread of monkeypox will stop in the U.S. anytime soon, but he said it\u2019s still possible in the long term.If domestic transmission were stopped, infections may still continue if people catch the virus while traveling internationally, he said.

The U.S. has the most infections of any country \u2014 more than 25,600. One U.S. death has been attributed to monkeypox.More than 97% of U.S. cases are men. The vast majority have been men who reported recent sexual contact with other men.Though cases have been declining, the proportion of new cases that have information about recent sexual contact is also down, officials said. That\u2019s causing a growing blind spot about how the virus may be spreading, Lipsitch noted.ALSO READ| Monkeypox cases rise in male sex networks, can it spread further?",

    "content": "Iran's clerical rulers are eager to crush mass anti-government protests, but maneuvering over the eventual succession to the supreme leader and rifts over security tactics have complicated efforts to curb the unrest, three analysts and an official said.The ever bolder protests, sparked by the death of a woman in police custody, have put Iran's leaders on the defensive, with officials apparently unable to close ranks behind an agreed response to the turmoil, the analysts and the official said.Challenging the legitimacy of Iran's top authority, protesters have this month burned pictures of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called for the downfall of the Islamic Republic and chanted \"Death to the Dictator\", unfazed by security forces using tear gas, clubs and, in some cases, live ammunition.The unrest poses a grave threat to the priority that has defined Khamenei's rule -- the survival of the four-decade-old Islamic Republic and its religious establishment, at any cost.But the fact that the unrest coincided with rumours about his ailing health -- he is 83 -- has only made matters worse, since the faction-ridden elite has been preoccupied with his eventual succession, the analysts and official said.ALSO READ | Security forces clash with protestors, over 75 killed as anti-hijab protests intensify in IranAlthough in theory an 86-member body known as the Assembly of Experts will choose the next leader, high level negotiations and jockeying for influence have already begun, making it difficult for the establishment to unite around a set of security tactics.\"This race has caused disarray inside the leadership. The deepening rift is the last thing we need when the country is in turmoil,\" said a hardline official.\"The main issue right now is the Islamic Republic's survival.\"Khamenei himself has been silent about the protests, which quickly grew into a revolt against what protesters said was the increasing authoritarianism of the ruling clerics.The two names that come up most often in speculation about the succession are President Ebrahim Raisi and Khamenei's second son Mojtaba, said Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\"Neither of them has popular support, but what keeps the Islamic Republic in power is not popular support, but repression. Both men are deeply experienced in repression,\" he said.Brazen protesters have directed anger at Mojtaba Khamenei, risking the wrath of his all-powerful father. \"Mojtaba, may you die and not become Supreme Leader,\" could be heard in videos from protests on Twitter.Alarmed by the depth of popular discontent and outrage, some senior clerics and politicians have appealed for restraint to avoid bloodshed that could galvanise and embolden protesters.But that has not stopped hardliners calling for tougher measures.\"A part of the establishment fears that this time using more lethal force can push the Islamic Republic to a no return point,\" said a senior former Iranian official.However, top authorities like hardliner Raisi have said that the protests \"would not lead to regime change\".Videos on social media show Iran's security forces struggling to end the protests, which were triggered by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini's death on Sept. 13. She had been arrested for \"unsuitable attire\" by the morality police who enforce the Islamic Republic's strict dress code.Reuters could not verify the videos.Demonstrations have spread from Amini's Kurdish hometown of Saqez to all of Iran's 31 provinces, with all layers of society, including ethnic and religious minorities, joining in.Fearing an ethnic uprising and in a show of power, Iran fired missiles and drones at targets in neighbouring northern Iraq's Kurdish region after accusing Iranian Kurdish dissidents of being involved in the unrest. Rights groups say Kurds and other religious and ethnic minorities face discrimination under the clerical establishment.A collapse of the Islamic Republic may seem remote in the near term, since its leaders are determined not to show the kind of weakness they believe sealed the fate of the U.S.-backed Shah in 1979, a senior Iranian official told Reuters.But unrestrained repression seems off the menu, for now. An Assistant Professor of political science at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, Saeid Golkar said \"further delegitimisation of the regime\" could be behind the establishment's decision to choose \"attrition repression instead of the 2019 iron fist strategy\".Protests over fuel prices rises in 2019 - when Reuters reported 1,500 people were killed - were the bloodiest confrontation in the Islamic Republic's history.Iranian state media said 41 people, including members of security forces, died during the unrest. Amnesty international said on Friday \"the crackdown has left at least 52 identified victims dead and hundreds injured to date\". Thousands have been arrested, according to rights groups.International support for the protests has made it harder for the authorities to crack down, especially as there are no apparent protest leaders who can be identified and rounded up.Iran\u2019s rulers have accused a coalition of \u201canarchists, terrorists and foreign foes\" of orchestrating the troubles -- a narrative few Iranians believe.\"Iran\u2019s leaders are probably trying to see if a combination of internet shutdowns, mass arrests, and some violence against protesters will slow the momentum of the protests,\" said Eurasia Group analyst Henry Rome.\"But I don\u2019t think anyone should doubt that, at the end of the day, the state has a backstop of loyal enforcers willing to kill their fellow citizens who can be called upon to end this round of protests.\"",

    "content": "Brazil's presidential election is headed for a run-off vote, electoral authorities said on Sunday, after President Jair Bolsonaro's surprising strength in a first-round vote spoiled rival Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's hopes of winning outright.With 95% of electronic votes counted, Lula was ahead with 47.6% of votes versus 43.9% for Bolsonaro, the national electoral authority reported. As neither got a majority of support, the race will go to a second-round vote on Oct. 30.Several opinion surveys had shown Lula leading Bolsonaro by 10-15 percentage points ahead of Sunday's vote. The much tighter result dashed expectations of a quick resolution to a deeply polarized election in the world's fourth-largest democracy.Bolsonaro had questioned polls that showed him losing to Lula in the first round, saying they did not capture enthusiasm he saw on the campaign trail. He has also attacked the integrity of Brazil's electronic voting system without evidence, and suggested he might not concede if he lost.Political observers had said a wide margin of victory for Lula could sap Bolsonaro of support to challenge the electoral results. But Sunday's vote, extending a tense and violent election by another four weeks, revitalized his campaign.ALSO READ| Luiz Lula likely to win Brazil presidential election, shows poll survey\"The extreme right is very strong across Brazil,\" said Carlos Melo, a political scientist at the Insper business school. \"Lula's second-round victory is now less likely. Bolsonaro will arrive with a lot of strength for re-election.\"Some polls had suggested Lula could win over 50% of valid votes, allowing him to avoid the run-off against his fierce rival. But as results trickled in, that looked unlikely.Outside Bolsonaro's family home in Rio de Janeiro's Barra da Tijuca neighborhood, the scene of jubilant celebrations when Bolsonaro was elected in 2018, the mood was increasingly upbeat.Maria Lourdes de Noronha, 63, said only fraud could prevent a Bolsonaro victory, adding that \"we will not accept it\" if he loses. \"The polls in our country, the media, and journalists, are liars, rascals, shameless,\" she said.Although he ended his 2003-2010 government with record popularity, Lula is now loathed by many Brazilians after he was convicted of accepting bribes and jailed during the last election. His conviction was later overturned by the Supreme Court, allowing him to face his rival Bolsonaro this year, along with nine other candidates from an array of smaller parties.A career lawmaker turned self-styled outsider, Bolsonaro rode a backlash against Lula's Workers Party to victory in 2018, uniting strands of Brazil's right, from evangelical Christians to farming interests and pro-gun advocates.ALSO READ| Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro now stable, was rushed to hospital over intestinal obstructionHe has dismantled environmental and indigenous protections to the delight of commercial farmers and wildcat miners, while pushing an anti-gay and anti-abortion agenda.His popularity has suffered since the coronavirus pandemic, which he dismissed as a \"little flu.\" Corruption scandals also forced ministers out of his government and focused a harsh spotlight on his lawmaker sons.Yet Sunday's vote shows his support is far from collapsing.Lula's proposals for Brazil have been light on details, but he promises to improve the fortunes of Brazil's poor and working classes, as he did as president from 2003-2010, when he lifted millions out of poverty and burnished Brazil's global influence.While in power, Lula's approval rating soared as he expanded Brazil's social safety net amid a commodity-driven economic boom. But in the years after he left office, the economy collapsed, his hand-picked successor was impeached and many of his associates went to prison.Lula himself spent 19 months in jail for bribery convictions that were thrown out by the Supreme Court last year.ALSO READ| Brazil's leftist former president takes on rightist Bolsonaro in dramatic fight",

    "content": "A revived Hurricane Ian pounded coastal South Carolina on Friday, ripping apart piers and flooding streets after the ferocious storm caused catastrophic damage in Florida, trapping thousands in their homes and leaving at least 17 people dead.The powerful storm, estimated to be one of the costliest hurricanes ever to hit the U.S., has terrorized people for much of the week \u2014 pummeling western Cuba and raking across Florida before gathering strength in the warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean to curve back and strike South Carolina.While Ian\u2019s center came ashore near Georgetown, South Carolina, on Friday with much weaker winds than when it crossed Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast earlier in the week, the storm left many areas of Charleston\u2019s downtown peninsula under water. It also washed way parts of four piers along the coast, including two at Myrtle Beach.ALSO READ | Hurricane Ian heads for Carolinas after leaving swath of destruction in FloridaOnline cameras showed seawater filling neighborhoods in Garden City to calf level. As Ian moved across South Carolina on its way to North Carolina Friday evening, it dropped from a hurricane to a post-tropical cyclone.Ian left a broad swath of destruction in Florida, flooding areas on both of its coasts, tearing homes from their slabs, demolishing beachfront businesses and leaving more than 2 million people without power.Many of the deaths were drownings, including that of a 68-year-old woman swept away into the ocean by a wave. A 67-year-old man who was waiting to be rescued died after falling into rising water inside his home, authorities said.ALSO READ | Death toll in Florida uncertain as Hurricane Ian takes aim at CarolinasOther storm-related fatalities included a 22-year-old woman who died after an ATV rollover from a road washout and a 71-year-old man who fell off a roof while putting up rain shutters. An 80-year-old woman and a 94-year-old man who relied on oxygen machines also died after the equipment stopped working during power outages.Another three people died in Cuba earlier in the week as the storm churned northward. The death toll was expected to increase substantially once emergency officials have an opportunity to search many of the hardest-hit areas.Rescue crews piloted boats and waded through riverine streets in Florida after the storm to save thousands of people trapped amid flooded homes and shattered buildings. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Friday that crews had gone door-to-door to over 3,000 homes in the hardest-hit areas.\u201cThere\u2019s really been a Herculean effort,\u201d he said during a news conference in Tallahassee.Hurricane Ian has likely caused \u201cwell over $100 billion\u201d in damage, including $63 billion in privately insured losses, according to the disaster modeling firm Karen Clark & Company, which regularly issues flash catastrophe estimates. If those numbers are borne out, that would make Ian at least the fourth costliest hurricane in U.S. history.Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said first responders have focused so far on \u201chasty\u201d searches, aimed at emergency rescues and initial assessments, which will be followed by two additional waves of searches. Initial responders who come across possible remains are leaving them without confirming, he said Friday, describing as an example the case of a submerged home.\u201cThe water was up over the rooftop, right, but we had a Coast Guard rescue swimmer swim down into it and he could identify that it appeared to be human remains. We do not know exactly how many,\u201d Guthrie said.Desperate to locate and rescue their loved ones, social media users shared phone numbers, addresses and photos of their family members and friends online for anyone who can check on them.Orlando residents returned to flooded homes Friday, rolling up their pants to wade through muddy, knee-high water in their streets. Friends of Ramon Rodriguez dropped off ice, bottled water and hot coffee at the entrance to his subdivision, where 10 of the 50 homes were flooded and the road looked like a lake. He had no power or food at his house, and his car was trapped by the water.\u201cThere\u2019s water everywhere,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cThe situation here is pretty bad.\u201dALSO READ | Reporter flies away, sharks on streets: Hurricane Ian lashes FloridaThe devastating storm surge destroyed many older homes on the barrier island of Sanibel, Florida, and gouged crevices into its sand dunes. Taller condominium buildings were intact but with the bottom floor blown out. Trees and utility poles were strewn everywhere.Municipal rescuers, private teams and the Coast Guard used boats and helicopters Friday to evacuate residents who stayed for the storm and then were cut off from the mainland when a causeway collapsed. Volunteers who went to the island on personal watercraft helped escort an elderly couple to an area where Coast Guard rescuers took them aboard a helicopter. Hours after weakening to a tropical storm while crossing the Florida peninsula, Ian regained strength Thursday evening over the Atlantic. Ian made landfall in South Carolina with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 kph). When it hit Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast on Wednesday, it was a powerful Category 4 hurricane with 150 mph (240 kph).After the heaviest of the rainfall blew through Charleston, Will Shalosky examined a large elm tree in front of his house that had fallen across his downtown street. He noted the damage could have been much worse.\u201cIf this tree has fallen a different way, it would be in our house,\u201d Shalosky said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty scary, pretty jarring.\u201dIan\u2019s heavy rains and winds crossed into North Carolina on Friday evening. Gov. Roy Cooper warned residents to be vigilant, given that up to 8 inches (20.3 centimeters) of rain could fall in some areas\u201cHurricane Ian is at our door. Expect drenching rain and sustained heavy winds over most of our state,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cOur message today is simple: Be smart and be safe.\u201dIn Washington, President Joe Biden said he was directing \u201cevery possible action be taken to save lives and get help to survivors.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to take months, years to rebuild,\u201d Biden said.\u201cI just want the people of Florida to know, we see what you\u2019re going through and we\u2019re with you.\u201d",

The signs point to a hot spot of gas bubble orbiting the Sagittarius A*, which could further help in understanding the dynamics of the mysterious object.A black hole is formed from the death of a star with such a high gravitational field that the matter gets squeezed into the small space under it, trapping the light of the dead star. The gravity is so strong due to the matter being squeezed into a tiny space. Since no light can get out, people can't see black holes.Scientists made the latest observation of the black hole in the centre of our galaxy using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the Chilean Andes during the campaign by the Event Horizon Telescope, that first snapped the picture of the black hole.\"We think we're looking at a hot bubble of gas zipping around Sagittarius A* on an orbit similar in size to that of the planet Mercury but making a full loop in just around 70 minutes. This requires a mind-blowing velocity of about 30% of the speed of light!\" says Maciek Wielgus of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy.Also Read | Meet Dart, a space probe that will bang into an asteroid this MondayThe researchers, in a paper published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, reported about the polarized light curves of the Galactic Center supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*. The hot gas bubble was detected in some observations that were done shortly after a burst or flare of X-ray energy was emitted from the center of our galaxy picked up by the Chandra Space Telescope.\"What is really new and interesting is that such flares were so far only clearly present in X-ray and infrared observations of Sagittarius A*. Here we see for the first time a very strong indication that orbiting hot spots are also present in radio observations,\" Wielgus said in a statement.Also Read | Worrying trends in Arctic as sea ice cover declines to record levelThe new findings support the idea that these flares originate from magnetic interactions in the scorching gas orbiting very close to Sagittarius A*. ALMA also allows astronomers to study polarised radio emissions from Sagittarius A*, which can be used to unveil the black hole's magnetic field.It is worth mentioning that astronomers in May this year revealed the first image of the black hole at the centre of our galaxy, which was pictured using the Event Horizon Telescope.

    "content": "Major leaks that suddenly erupted in the Nord Stream gas pipelines that run from Russia to Europe under the Baltic Sea have generated plenty of theories but few clear answers about who or what caused the damage.Here is what we know and what has been said so far:So far, Western governments and officials have avoided pointing a finger directly, while Russia has blamed the West.European Union states say they believe the damage was caused by sabotage but have stopped short of naming anyone. Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency, said it was \"very obvious\" who was behind it but did not say who that was.The Kremlin said allegations of Russian responsibility were \"stupid\" and Russian officials have said Washington had a motive as it wants to sell more liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe.President Vladimir Putin said on Friday the United States and its allies blew up Nord Stream. \"The sanctions were not enough for the Anglo-Saxons: they moved onto sabotage,\" he said.In previous comments, the White House has dismissed the accusation that it was responsible. US President Joe Biden said on Friday damage to Nord Stream was a deliberate act of sabotage.Read | Vladimir Putin accuses West of blowing up Nord Stream pipelinesGerman Navy Chief Jan Christian Kaack told German daily Die Welt in Monday's edition, the day leaks were found although he was apparently speaking before that: \"Russia has also built up considerable capacity underwater. At the bottom of the Baltic Sea, but also in the Atlantic, there is quite a bit of critical infrastructure like pipelines or submarine cables for IT.\"\"[Russia] can intimidate Europeans through an act of sabotage. Because if they're able to blow up these pipelines on the Baltic seabed, they could do that as well to the new pipeline,\" said Kristine Berzina, senior fellow for security and defence at the German Marshall Fund.Read | Nord Stream pipeline Leak: What has unfolded so farHowever, if it was an act of sabotage, it has damaged pipelines that were built by Kremlin-controlled Gazprom and its European partners at a cost that ran into billions of dollars.The damage also means Russia loses an element of leverage it still had over Europe, which has been racing to find other gas supplies for winter, even if the Nord Stream pipelines were not pumping gas when the leaks were discovered, analysts say.Whoever or whatever is to blame, Ukraine may also be a beneficiary. Kyiv has long called for Europe to halt all purchases of Russian fuel - even though some gas still runs to Europe across its territory. Disrupting Nord Stream brings Kyiv's call for a full Russian fuel embargo closer to reality.Experts say the scale of the damage and the fact that the leaks are far from each other on two different pipelines indicate that the act was intentional and well-orchestrated.Seismologists in Denmark and Sweden said they had registered two powerful blasts on Monday in the vicinity of the leaks and the explosions were in the water, not under the seabed.A British defence source told Sky News the attack was probably premeditated and detonated from afar using underwater mines or other explosives.\"Something big caused those explosions, which means ... Russia could do it. In theory, the United States could also do it but I don't really see the motivation there,\" Oliver Alexander, an open source intelligence analyst, told Reuters.Read | Explained: Nord Stream gas pipelines leak and a possible 'sabotage'The United States had long called for Europe to end its reliance on Russian gas, he said, but Washington had little obvious motivation to act now because Nord Stream was no longer pumping gas to Europe at the time the leaks were found, although the pipelines had gas under pressure inside them.\"They already succeeded in stopping Nord Stream 2. It was already dead in the water, it wasn't going anywhere,\" he said.Analysts say it is possible the damage was inflicted by devices that are available on the commercial market but that, given the scale and precision, it was more likely carried out by an actor with access to more sophisticated technology.The US news channel CNN, citing three sources, reported that European security officials had observed Russian navy support ships and submarines not far from the sites of the Nord Stream leaks. Asked about the report, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there had been a much larger NATO presence in the area.At Russia's request, the UN Security Council meets on Friday to discuss the damage to the pipelines, while the Europeans are pressing on with their investigations.For now, however, more direct fingerpointing between Russia and the West could worsen tensions that have already spiralled over the war in Ukraine, said Marek Swierczynski, a defence analyst for Polish think tank Polityka Insight.Read | How Nord Stream pipeline leak is a threat to climate",

    "content": "Pakistan captain Babar Azam said that his team needs to improve in the shortest format after losing the deciding T20I against England.England completed their first tour of Pakistan in 17 years with a 67-run win in the seventh T20I to clinch the series 4-3 in Lahore on Sunday, October 2.\"It was definitely difficult,\" Babar said in the post-match presentation. \"With 200 runs on the board, if we lose early wickets, it puts pressure on the other batters. This series was vital for us. We need to improve in the shortest format. I also mentioned at the toss, that we have a good bowling attack. Haris is bowling well, and he is improving everyday. I think entire Pakistan was waiting for this, even we were happy to host England.\"England posted 209/3 after being put in to bat. Dawid Malan (78* off 47) hit a half-century and Harry Brook's 29-ball 46 not out ensured a brilliant finish for the visitors after both being dropped thrice.In reply, Pakistan suffered an early collapse with their prolific opening pair Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan returning to dugout cheaply. Shan Masood (56 off 43) tried to fight back, but could not find much support from the other end as Pakistan kept on losing wickets at regular intervals.Eventually, England managed to restrict Pakistan on 142/8 in 20 overs. Chris Woakes was the pick of England bowlers, having taken a three-wicket haul, while David Willey returned with two scalps.\"We saw this as a final, so to do it under pressure and put up a big score was fantastic,\" said Malan, who was named the Player of the Match. \"We felt the first 12-14 overs, it was coming on nicely, then it slowed up.\"Luckily our bowlers learned from their lessons with the ball, bowl into the wicket, changes of pace. They bowled fantastically well. We're getting a break here and there, looking forward to getting to Australia and having a couple of days off. But it's been fantastic to be here, thanks for having us.\"",

    "content": "The India Space Research Organisation (Isro) has developed an artificial smart limb that could help amputees in walking with a comfortable gait. The artificial limb is a spin-off from space technology that could be manufactured for commercial use soon. The smart is expected to be cheaper by about ten times.The newly announced smart tech is called Microprocessor-Controlled Knees (MPKs), which offers extended capabilities for the amputee more than those offered by the passive limbs that do not use the microprocessors. Nearly 1.6 kilograms in weight, Isro says the smart limb under development, at the moment, enabled an amputee to walk about 100 meters in the corridor with minimum support.These smart MPKs are being developed by Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), Isro under an MoU with the National Institute for Locomotor Disabilities (NILD), Pt. Deendayal Upadhyaya National Institute for Persons with Physical Disabilities, and the Artificial Limb Manufacturing Corporation of India (ALIMCO).Isro, in a release, said that the smart limb consists of a microprocessor, hydraulic damper, load & knee angle sensors, composite knee-case, Li-ion battery, electrical harness, and interface elements. It detects the state of gait based on the sensor data and the control software estimates the real-time damping needed to attain the desired gait by changing the stiffness of the system.Also Read | Tonga explosion could warm Earth: Study reveals it was more violent than it appeared\"Walking parameters specific to amputees can be set using PC-based software to improve one\u2019s comfort. The interface plots the parameters in real-time during walking. The feasibility of the design was verified using an engineering model,\" Isro said in the release.The proof of concept model of the limb was developed in an aluminum knee case, a solenoid valve-based damper, and a six-axis load cell, which then went on to use DC motor-based damper with a spool position sensor, pylon integrated load cell, miniaturized control electronics, and a Graphical user interface for parameter tuning in the next phase.Also Read | China sounds Red Alert as biggest freshwater lake goes dryIsro then tested the technology with an amputee after attaining clearance from the Joint Project Monitoring Committee for conducting walking trials. \"Initial walking trials were conducted with the support of parallel bars. Subsequently, the amputee could walk about 100 m in the corridor with minimum support. All the sub-systems of the knee performed satisfactorily,\" the Indian space agency said.Isro said that the new technology is estimated to be priced at Rs 4-5 lakh, while the currently available limbs are priced at Rs 10-60 lakh.Also Read | Meet Dart, a space probe that will bang into an asteroid this Monday",

    "content": "More than a dozen soldiers seized control of Burkina Faso\u2019s state television late on Friday, declaring that the country\u2019s coup leader-turned-president, Lt. Col. Paul Henri Sandaogo Damiba, had been overthrown after only nine months in power.A statement read by a junta spokesman said Capt. Ibrahim Traore is the new military leader of Burkina Faso, a volatile West African country that is battling a mounting Islamic insurgency.Burkina Faso\u2019s new military leaders said the country\u2019s borders had been closed and a curfew would be in effect from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. The transitional government and national assembly were ordered dissolved.Damiba and his allies overthrew the democratically elected president, coming to power with promises of make the country more secure. However, violence has continued unabated and frustration with his leadership has grown in recent months.\u201cFaced by the continually worsening security situation, we the officers and junior officers of the national armed forces were motivated to take action with the desire to protect the security and integrity of our country,\u201d said the statement read by the junta spokesman, Capt. Kiswendsida Farouk Azaria Sorgho.The soldiers promised the international community they would respect their commitments and urged Burkinabes \u201cto go about their business in peace.\u201d\u201cA meeting will be convened to adopt a new transitional constitution charter and to select a new Burkina Faso president be it civilian or military,\u201d Sorgho added.Damiba had just returned from addressing the U.N. General Assembly in New York as Burkina Faso\u2019s head of state. Tensions, though, had been mounting for months. In his speech, Damiba defended his January coup as \u201can issue of survival for our nation,\u201d even if it was \u201dperhaps reprehensible\u201d to the international community.Constantin Gouvy, Burkina Faso researcher at Clingendael, said Friday night\u2019s events \u201cfollow escalating tensions within the ruling MPSR junta and the wider army about strategic and operational decisions to tackle spiraling insecurity.\u201d\u201cMembers of the MPSR increasingly felt Damiba was isolating himself and casting aside those who helped him seize power,\u201d Gouvy told The Associated Press.Gunfire had erupted in the capital, Ouagadougou, early Friday and hours passed without any public appearance by Damiba. Late in the afternoon, his spokesman posted a statement on the presidency\u2019s Facebook page saying that \u201cnegotiations are underway to bring back calm and serenity.\u201dFriday\u2019s developments felt all too familiar in West Africa, where a coup in Mali in August 2020 set off a series of military power grabs in the region. Mali also saw a second coup nine months after the August 2020 overthrow of its president, when the junta\u2019s leader sidelined his civilian transition counterparts and put himself alone in charge.On the streets of Ouagadougou, some people already were showing support Friday for the change in leadership even before the putschists took to the state airwaves.Francois Beogo, a political activist from the Movement for the Refounding of Burkina Faso, said Damiba \u201chas showed his limits.\u201d\u201cPeople were expecting a real change,\u201d he said of the January coup d\u2019etat.Some demonstrators voiced support for Russian involvement in order to stem the violence, and shouted slogans against France, Burkina Faso\u2019s former colonizer. In neighboring Mali, the junta invited Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group to help secure the country, though their deployment has drawn international criticism.Many in Burkina Faso initially supported the military takeover last January, frustrated with the previous government\u2019s inability to stem Islamic extremist violence that has killed thousands and displaced at least 2 million.Yet the violence has failed to wane in the months since Damiba took over. Earlier this month, he also took on the position of defense minister after dismissing a brigadier general from the post.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for the Burkinabe junta to claim that it has delivered on its promise of improving the security situation, which was its pretext for the January coup,\u201d said Eric Humphery-Smith, senior Africa analyst at the risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft.Earlier this week, at least 11 soldiers were killed and 50 civilians went missing after a supply convoy was attacked by gunmen in Gaskinde commune in Soum province in the Sahel. That attack was \u201ca low point\u201d for Damiba\u2019s government and \u201clikely played a role in inspiring what we\u2019ve seen so far today,\u201d added Humphery-Smith.U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Friday that nearly one-fifth of Burkina Faso\u2019s population \u201curgently needs humanitarian aid.\u201d\u201cBurkina Faso needs peace, it needs stability, and it needs unity in order to fight terrorist groups and criminal networks operating in parts of the country,\u201d Dujarric said.Chrysogone Zougmore, president of the Burkina Faso Movement for Human Rights, called Friday\u2019s developments \u201cvery regrettable,\u201d saying the instability would not help in the fight against the Islamic extremist violence.\u201cHow can we hope to unite people and the army if the latter is characterized by such serious divisions?\u201d Zougmore said. \u201cIt is time for these reactionary and political military factions to stop leading Burkina Faso adrift.\u201d",

Poyang lake has dwindled to a record low, which is also a vital flood outlet for the Yangtze, China's longest river.The Yangtze has been facing the consequences of one of the worst droughts experienced by several parts of China in the 21st century. Water levels at a key monitoring spot in the Yangtze have fallen from 19.43 meters to 7.1 meters over the last three months.

According to a report in Reuters, rainfall since July is 60% lower than a year earlier, and 267 weather stations across China reported record temperatures in August.This year's heat wave began on June 13 and didn't officially end until Aug. 30, driven by an unusually large and intense Western Pacific Subtropical Highweather system stretching over large parts of Asia. Xiao Chan, vice director of China's National Meteorological Center, had earlier this week said that the duration, intensity, extent, and impact of the heat wave made it the biggest since records began in 1961.Also Read | Build it like bob: These bee-inspired drones can 3D print buildings | WATCHWhile rains in much of southwest China have brought some relief, several regions in central China continue to suffer under the impact of drought. Reuters reported that the extremely dry conditions have now stretched to more than 70 days in Jiangxi. A total of 10 reservoirs in neighbouring Anhui province have fallen below the \"dead pool\" level, meaning they are unable to discharge water downstream.China's southwest was the worst hit, with temperatures reaching highs of 45C in parts of the region of Chongqing. Neighbouring Sichuan province also saw big declines in hydroelectric generation, forcing power rationing throughout the region. However, parts of the central Yangtze basin still remain stricken by drought, including the provinces of Hubei, Jiangxi, and Hunan.Also Read | Meet Dart, a space probe that will bang into an asteroid this Monday",

    "content": "The death toll from Hurricane Ian climbed past 80 on Sunday as embattled residents in Florida and the Carolinas faced a recovery expected to cost tens of billions of dollars, and some officials faced criticism over their response to the storm.The death toll was expected to keep rising as floodwaters receded and search teams pushed farther into areas initially cut off from the outside world. Hundreds of people have been rescued as emergency workers sifted through homes and buildings inundated with water or completely washed away.At least 85 storm-related deaths have been confirmed since Ian crashed ashore Florida's Gulf Coast with catastrophic force on Wednesday as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).Florida accounted for all but four of the fatalities, with 42 tallied by the sheriff's office in coastal Lee County, which bore the brunt of the storm when it made landfall, and 39 other deaths reported by officials in four neighbouring counties.VIDEO: Aerial images show the devastating aftermath of deadly Hurricane Ian in Florida.The death toll has risen above 40, authorities said, as the southern state took stock of the aftermath of one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the United States pic.twitter.com/TPUvdbNEz7Officials in Lee County, which includes Fort Myers and Cape Coral and is on the Gulf Coast, have faced questions over whether they mandated evacuations in time.Cecil Pendergrass, chairman of the county's board of commissioners, said on Sunday that once the county was forecast to be in the cone, or the probable track of the hurricane's center, evacuation orders were given. Even then, some people chose to ride the storm out, Pendergrass said.\"I respect their choices,\" he said at a press conference. \"But I'm sure a lot of them regret it now.\"President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will see the devastation in Florida firsthand on Wednesday, the White House said in a statement on Saturday. The Bidens will visit Puerto Rico on Monday, where hundreds of thousands of people were still without power two weeks after Hurricane Fiona hit the island.Cuba is restoring power after Ian knocked out electricity to the whole country of 11 million people, flattened homes and obliterated agricultural fields.North Carolina authorities said at least four people had been killed there. No deaths were immediately reported in South Carolina, where Ian made another US landfall on Friday.Chugging over land since then, Ian has diminished into an ever-weakening post-tropical cyclone.The National Hurricane Center forecast more heavy rainfall was possible across parts of West Virginia and western Maryland into Sunday morning, and \"major to record flooding\" in central Florida.As the full scope of devastation became clearer, officials said some of the heaviest damage was inflicted by wind-driven ocean surf that raged into seaside communities and washed buildings away.Satellite images from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) showed beach cottages and a motel that lined the shores of Florida's Sanibel Island had been demolished by storm surges. Although most homes appeared to still be standing, roof damage to all was evident.Surveys from the ground showed that the barrier island, a popular tourist getaway that was home to some 6,000, was devastated.\"It's all just completely gone,\" Sanibel's city manager, Dana Souza, said. \"Our electric system is pretty much destroyed, our sewer system has been damaged badly and our public water supply is under assessment.\"The island's link to the mainland was severed by breaches to its causeway bridge, further complicating recovery efforts, Souza said.After waning to a tropical storm by the end of its march across Florida to the Atlantic, Ian regained hurricane strength and pummelled coastal South Carolina on Friday, sweeping ashore near Georgetown, north of the historic port city of Charleston.Numerous roads were flooded and blocked by fallen trees while a number of piers were damaged in that area.More than 700,000 businesses and homes remained without power on Sunday afternoon in Florida alone, where more than 2 million customers lost electricity the first night of the storm.Insurers braced for between $28 billion and $47 billion in claims from what could amount to the costliest Florida storm since Hurricane Andrew in 1992, according to US property data and analytics company CoreLogic.",

    "content": "North Korea on Saturday fired two short-range ballistic missiles toward its eastern waters, South Korean and Japanese officials said, making it the North\u2019s fourth round of weapons launches this week that are seen as a response to military drills among its rivals.South Korea\u2019s military said that it detected the two North Korean missile launches 18 minutes apart on Saturday morning coming from the North\u2019s capital region. Japan\u2019s Defense Ministry said it also spotted the launches.\u201cThe repeated ballistic missile firings by North Korea are a grave provocation that undermines peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and in the international community,\u201d South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.It said South Korea strongly condemns the launches and urges North Korea to stop testing ballistic missiles.Toshiro Ino, Japan\u2019s vice defense minister, called the launches \u201cabsolutely impermissible.\u201d He said the four rounds of missile testing by North Korea in a week is \u201cunprecedented.\u201dALSO READ | DRDO tests of Very Short Range Air Defence System missiles successfulAccording to South Korean and Japanese estimates, the North Korean missiles flew about 350-400 kilometers (220-250 miles) at a maximum altitude of 30-50 kilometers (20-30 miles) before they landed in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.Ino, the Japanese vice minister, said the missiles showed \u201cirregular\u201d trajectory. The five other ballistic missiles fired by North Korea on three occasions this week also show similar low trajectories.Some experts say that the weapons are a nuclear-capable, highly maneuverable missiles modeled after Russia\u2019s Iskander missile. That Iskander-like missile is capable of striking strategic targets in South Korea, including U.S. military bases there.Saturday\u2019s launches came a day after South Korea, Japan and the United States held their first trilateral anti-submarine drills in five years off the Korean Peninsula\u2019s east coast. Earlier this week, South Korean and U.S. warships conducted bilateral exercises in the area for four days. Both military drills this week involved the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan and its battle group.North Korea views such military drills among its rivals as an invasion rehearsal and often responds with its own weapons tests.The North Korean missile tests this week also came before and after U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris visited South Korea on Thursday and reaffirmed the \u201cironclad\u201d U.S. commitment to the security of its Asian allies.This year, North Korea has carried out a record number of missile tests in what experts call an attempt to expand its weapons arsenal amid stalled nuclear diplomacy with the United States. The weapons tested this year included nuclear-capable missiles with the ability to reach the U.S. mainland, South Korea and Japan.South Korean and US officials say North Korea has also completed preparations to conduct a nuclear test, which would be its first in five years.Experts say North Korean leader Kim Jong Un eventually wants to use the enlarged nuclear arsenal to pressure the United States and others accept his country as a legitimate nuclear state, a recognition he views as necessary to win the lifting of international sanctions and other concessions.Multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions ban North Korea from testing ballistic missiles and nuclear devices. The country\u2019s missile launches this year are seen as exploiting a divide at the U.N. council over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and U.S.-China competitions.In May, China and Russia vetoed a U.S.-led attempt to toughen sanctions on North Korea over its ballistic missile launches.\u201cNorth Korea\u2019s frequent short-range missile tests may strain the isolated state\u2019s resources. But because of deadlock on the U.N. Security Council, they are a low-cost way for the Kim regime to signal its displeasure with Washington and Seoul\u2019s defense exercises while playing the domestic politics of countering an external threat,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.",

This is contrary to the very nature of man, truth, freedom, and justice,\" he added.The ceremony took place three days after the completion of referenda in the four regions on September 23-27, in which Moscow-backed leaders claimed victory and signed the agreement to formally join Russia.\"This is the will of millions of people,\" President Putin said in his speech at Kremlin.Moscow's Red Square was closed to the public ahead of the ceremony, where banners read Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson\u2014Russia!\"I order the recognition of the state's sovereignty and independence,\" Putin said in the decrees.The four territories create a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed by Moscow in 2014 in a similar process.Apart from the planned ceremony in the Georgievsky Hall (St George\u2019s Hall) of the Great Kremlin Palace, Putin delivered a speech at an event on the Red Square.Flanked by the leaders of their Russian-backed administrations, with the multi-coloured spires of the 16th-century St Basil's Cathedral as the backdrop, Putin said people in the regions had made a choice to re-join their \"historic motherland.\"Putin also called on Kyiv to return to the negotiating table. Moscow is ready for talks with Kyiv, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday.\"We call on the Kyiv regime to cease all hostilities, stop the war it started back in 2014, and return to the negotiating table,\" he said, adding, however, that Moscow will not \"betray\" the territories that want to become a part of Russia.Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was only ready for peace talks if and when Russia got a new president. Ukraine also formally applied for fast-track membership in Nato, something Moscow fiercely opposes.\"Clearly, with this Russian president, it is impossible. He does not know what dignity and honesty are. Therefore, we are ready for a dialogue with Russia, but with another president of Russia,\" Zelenskyy said.To the question of Ukraine\u2019s membership in Nato, its chief Jens Stoltenberg did not respond directly but alluded to the difficulties in Ukraine\u2019s inclusion, since the decision on membership works on consensus.\"Every democracy in Europe has the right to apply for Nato membership, and we respect that right. We have repeated that Nato's door remains open, and we have demonstrated that over the last few years. Nato allies, when they met at the summit in Madrid, said so very clearly that we support Ukraine's right to choose its own path and to decide what kind of security arrangements they want to be part of,\" said Stoltenberg.Read | Vladimir Putin comes down heavily on colonisation by West, mentions 'plundering of India'",

    "content": "Earth, while alone in the darkness of space, is not really fully alone when it comes to incoming guests from deep space. These guests are mostly objects that are remnants of the origin of the solar system. One such remnant struck Earth about 66 million years ago, wiping dinosaurs from the face of the planet.We call them Near Earth Objects (NEO) and among them are asteroids. Just last week, five of them came close to Earth in what is called a planetary flyby. While there was no danger from these objects, there could be one in the future that could be on its way to hit us. Nasa, which tracks these outer space objects, wants to be ready to hit them back and is set to test a technology that will deflect these incoming asteroids if one dared to in the future.The technology is already on its way to the asteroid, where it will intentionally crash to test a kinetic impactor method to slightly change the orbit of the asteroid. They call it DART.The Double Asteroid Redirection Test or DART is a first-of-its-kind spacecraft, which has been designed to test a unique method to deflect an asteroid coming towards Earth with a high chance of impacting the planet. The spacecraft will intentionally crash on the asteroid to change its motion in space through kinetic impact.Also Read | After getting into cars, Saudi women set to go into spaceNasa has said that the mission is a test of the ability to achieve a kinetic impact on an asteroid and observe the asteroid\u2019s response. If successful, the method will become a key element of the planetary defense effort against Near Earth Objects, which includes findings, tracking, and then hitting them to change their course of movement.The target for the unique mission is the binary, near-Earth asteroid system Didymos, which at the moment does not pose any threat to Earth. The system composes of two NEos, an asteroid about 780-meter wide and its moonlet, Dimorphos about 160-meters in size.Dart will collide with Dimorphos, which is orbiting Didymos, to slightly alter its orbit while travelling at a speed of roughly 24,000 kilometers per hour.Also Read | Super Saturn: A star with over 30 rings that are 200 times larger than SaturnThe near-Earth asteroid was originally discovered in 1996 by Joe Montani of the Spacewatch Project at the University of Arizona. The Didymos system is an eclipsing binary as viewed from Earth, meaning that Dimorphos passes in front of and behind Didymos as it orbits the larger asteroid as seen from Earth.Hopefully, the orbit of the asteroid slightly changes and when it comes to astronomical science and orbital dynamics, a slight degree of change in an object's orbit is enough to steer it away in space as gravity comes into play. A suit of telescopes both on the ground and in space will be observing the crash.We will also be bringing you LIVE coverage of the crash here.Also Read | This experiment makes you feel zero-gravity of space on EarthAs the spacecraft collides with the asteroid, computers will take over creating a highly sophisticated and detailed simulation of the crash to evaluate the effectiveness of this mitigation approach and assess how best to apply it to future planetary defense scenarios. One of the mission objectives involves measuring the effects of the impact and resulting ejecta on Dimorphos.All eyes are now on Monday's critical impact when a human-made machine will officially end its journey by crashing on an asteroid and hopefully giving Earth a new tool to defend itself.Also Read | Having nightmares regularly?

The region has now experienced the 10th lowest summer ice in 2022 as it reached its annual minimum extent on September 18.The ice cover has shrunk to an area of 4.67 million square kilometers this year, which is roughly 1.55 million square kilometers below 1981-2010 average.

It added that the past 16 years have seen all the 10 lowest figures with 2022 tying 2017 and 2018 for the 10th-lowest in 44 years of observations.\u201cThis year marks a continuation of the much-reduced sea ice cover since the 1980s. That is not something that is random variations or chance. It represents a fundamental change in the ice cover in response to warming temperatures,\u201d Walt Meier, a sea ice researcher at the National Snow and Ice Data Center said.It is to be noted that every year Arctic sea ice melts through the warmer spring and summer months and usually reaches its minimum extent in September. As cooler weather and winter darkness sets in, the ice will grow again and reach its maximum extent around March.Also Read | After getting into cars, Saudi women set to go into spaceSea ice acts as a lid on a pot of boiling water, which when removed leads to heat and steam escaping into the air. Researchers say that the region is getting more heat and moisture from the ocean-going into the atmosphere, leading to a jump in warming. This warming and moistening of the atmosphere slows down the vertical growth of the sea ice, making it more vulnerable to melting in the summer months.Apart from having an impact on the global sea level, the Arctic ice also has a great deal of influence over clouds in the sky, which help in predicting how much and how fast the Arctic will continue to warm in the future.Also Read | Super Saturn: A star with over 30 rings that are 200 times larger than Saturn",

We will never recognise the results of these sham referendums or any annexation of Ukrainian territory,\u201d said UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly.\u201cThe Russian regime must be held to account for this abhorrent violation of international law. That\u2019s why we are working with our international partners to ramp up the economic pressure through new targeted services bans. What happens in Ukraine matters to us all, and the UK will do everything possible to assist their fight for freedom,\u201d he said.According to the FCDO, the UK is moving in lockstep with international partners and as Russia imports 67 per cent of its services from the sanctioning countries, it will impact access to IT services, advertising services, transactional legal advisory services and auditing services.The UK has also sanctioned Elvira Nabiullina, the Governor of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.The FCDO said that in her role, Nabiullina has been instrumental in steering the Russian economy through the Russian regime\u2019s illegal war against Ukraine and extending the ruble into the Ukrainian territories that are temporarily controlled by Russia.The governor is now personally subject to an asset freeze and travel ban. \u201cRussia is highly dependent on Western countries for legal services with 85 per cent of all legal services being imported from G7 countries given London is an international legal centre, the UK accounts for 59 per cent of these imports,\u201d the FCDO said.\u201cThe new legal advisory measures will cover certain commercial and transactional services and hamper Russia\u2019s businesses\u2019 ability to operate internationally. IT consultancy services will also be banned, including designing IT systems and software applications. Alongside the UK\u2019s previous ban on quantum computing exports and computing services, and with over 1,70,000 IT specialists fleeing Russia since the invasion began, these measures will further erode Russia\u2019s ability to maintain technological development with the rest of the world,\u201d it said.The export of almost 700 goods from the UK to Russia are also being banned. The list includes hundreds of goods that are critical for production in Russia\u2019s manufacturing sector, with imports from the UK totalling over GBP 200 million last year. In total, GBP 19 billion worth of UK-Russia trade has been wholly or partially sanctioned, based on official 2021 trade flows.",

Bigger things might occupy your mind during such an apocalyptic nuclear event, but make sure it's not a good hair day.If a nuclear bomb explodes, throwing clouds of radioactive dust into the air, make sure you hop into a shower as soon as possible. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has instructed people to seal off contaminated clothes and take a shower. Then comes the crucial part.Use shampoo since it is designed to cling to oil and dirt in your hair and carry away any dirty particles when you rinse the shampoo out. Conditioners also contain surfactants (that attract water at one end and oil at the other), but theirs have different properties.A shampoo can save your life, but a conditioner can be deadly. According to the advisory, avoid using conditioner on your hair to prevent significant radiation exposure. Conditioner can act like a glue between your hair and radioactive material.Most conditioners have what's called \"cationic\" surfactants, which are positively charged. Since hair fibres are negatively charged, they both attract and act as a glue for the radioactive dust. These radioactive particles can cause cell damage and even prove fatal.If one has been exposed to a nuclear explosion, they should also seek shelter inside a brick or concrete building to avoid radiation, as the US has recommended.

    "content": "The James Webb Space Telescope on Wednesday beamed back a series of images taken from the edge of the solar system, which showed Neptune out there in the vacuum of space. The image showed the planet covered in rings that had not been seen before.Our Solar System has several planets with rings, including Saturn and even Jupiter.But, out there in the vastness of the cosmos, remains a world that has not one or two but over 30 rings going around it covering a vast region expanding outwards. However, it's not a planet but a sun-like star. J1407 is much larger and heavier than the ring system of Saturn.Also Read | We have the clearest pictures of Neptune in over 30 years. It has ringsDiscovered by astronomer Eric Mamajek at the University of Rochester with his fellow colleagues from the Leiden Observatory, The Netherlands, the rings system was the first of its kind to have been discovered outside the Solar System. The discovery was confirmed about a decade ago in 2012.Analysis of data revealed that the star had over 30 rings extending over tens of millions of kilometers in diameter. While the star was too far to observe the rings directly, astronomers said that \"if we could replace Saturn\u2019s rings with the rings around J1407b, they would be easily visible at night and be many times larger than the full moon.\"Also Read | This is how a rocket launch looks from space with no bordersEric Mamajek, who had led the study at the time called it Super Saturn and said that the planet is much larger than Jupiter or Saturn, and its ring system is roughly 200 times larger than Saturn\u2019s rings are today. While it was initially believed to be a star, a new study pointed out that it could be a giant planet not yet seen with a gigantic ring system responsible for the repeated dimming of J1407\u2019s light.The rings are so wide that they block as much as 95 percent of the light of this young Sun-like star for days. Astronomers found at least one clean gap in the ring structure, which is more clearly defined in the new model. Astronomers expect that the rings will become thinner in the next several million years and eventually disappear as satellites form from the material in the disks.\u201cThe planetary science community has theorized for decades that planets like Jupiter and Saturn would have had, at an early stage, disks around them that then led to the formation of satellites. However, until we discovered this object in 2012, no one had seen such a ring system. This is the first snapshot of satellite formation on million-kilometer scales around a substellar object,\u201d Mamajek had said.While we continue to explore the Solar System and beyond, astronomers are hopeful that the James Webb Space Telescope could find more such interesting and never before see worlds in the universe.Also Read | Having nightmares regularly?

Condemning Russia\u2019s fraudulent attempt today to annex sovereign Ukrainian territory, he said Moscow is violating international law, trampling on the UN Charter, and showing its contempt for peaceful nations everywhere.\u201cMake no mistake: these actions have no legitimacy. The United States will always honour Ukraine\u2019s internationally recognised borders. We will continue to support Ukraine\u2019s efforts to regain control of its territory by strengthening its hand militarily and diplomatically, including through the USD 1.1 billion in additional security assistance the United States announced this week,\u201d Biden said.Soon thereafter, the Departments of Treasury, Commerce and State made detailed announcements of the swift and severe costs that the US is imposing on Russia for its fraudulent and unlawful annexation of regions of Ukraine.These include targeting additional Russian government officials and leaders, their family members, Russian and Belarusian military officials, and defence procurement networks, including international suppliers supporting Russia\u2019s military-industrial complex.\u201cToday we are sending a clear warning from the United States government, supported by G7 partners: There will be costs for any individual, entity, or country that provides political or economic support to Russia as a result of its illegal attempts to change the status of Ukrainian territory,\u201d a White House official said.\u201cToday, both the Department of Treasury and Commerce laid out the heightened sanctions and export control risks for entities and individuals inside or outside Russia that provide political or economic support to Russia for its purported annexation,\u201d it added.In addition, the Department of Treasury sanctioned 14 international suppliers for supporting Russia\u2019s military supply chains. The Treasury is also designating 109 additional State Duma members and 169 members of the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation.The Treasury designated Elvira Sakhipzadovna Nabiullina, the Governor of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) and a former advisor to Putin and Olga Nikolaevna Skorobogatova, the First Deputy Governor of the CBR.The Treasury and State also sanctioned relatives of members of Russia\u2019s National Security Council, such as Russian Prime Minister Mishustin\u2019s wife and two adult children and Minister of Defense Sergei Kuzhugetovich Shoigu\u2019s wife and adult children.The Department of Commerce added 57 entities to the Entity List and made clear that the current United States export controls on Russia can be applied to entities in third countries that seek to provide material support for Russia\u2019s and Belarus\u2019s military and industrial sectors, including to backfill technologies and other items prohibited by the United States and the 37 allies and partners that have implemented substantially similar controls.The Biden administration has levied numerous sanctions against Russian officials, financial institutions and allies since it first launched its invasion of Ukraine roughly six months ago, targeting Putin himself, his closest advisers and major banks in a bid to cut off financing and crush the Russian economy.The Biden administration has levied numerous sanctions against Russian officials, financial institutions and allies since it first launched its invasion of Ukraine in February, targeting Putin himself, his closest advisers and major banks in a bid to cut off financing and crush the Russian economy.Secretary of State Tony Blinken said that the US unequivocally rejects Russia\u2019s fraudulent attempt to change Ukraine\u2019s internationally recognised borders, including by holding sham \u201creferenda\u201d in Ukraine\u2019s Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya regions.\u201cThis is a clear violation of international law and the United Nations Charter.

    "content": "At least 92 people have been killed as Iran has cracked down on women-led protests sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini after her arrest by the notorious morality police, the group Iran Human Rights said Sunday.Kurdish Iranian Amini, 22, was pronounced dead on September 16 after she was detained for allegedly breaching rules requiring women to wear hijab headscarves and modest clothes, sparking Iran's biggest wave of popular unrest in almost three years.An additional 41 people died in clashes Friday in Iran's far southeast, an area bordering Afghanistan and Pakistan, reported Oslo-based IHR citing local sources, saying the protests were sparked by accusations a police chief in the region had raped a teenage girl of the Baluch minority.Solidarity rallies with Iranian women -- who have defiantly burnt the hijabs they have had to wear since the 1979 Islamic revolution -- have been held worldwide, with demonstrations in more than 150 cities on Saturday.Clashes between Iranian protesters and security forces have rocked cities nationwide for 16 nights in a row after they first flared in western regions home to Iran's Kurdish minority, where Amini hailed from.\"Rioters\" and \"thugs\", some hurling Molotov cocktails, attacked the Tehran headquarters of Iran's leading ultraconservative daily Kayhan on Saturday, said the newspaper, whose director is appointed by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.IHR director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam urged the international community to take urgent steps against the Islamic republic to stop the killing of Iranian protesters, saying they amount to \"crimes against humanity\".Read | Anti-hijab protests rock Iran over Mahsa Amini\u2019s death in custody: What we know so farAt least 92 protesters in the Mahsa Amini rallies have been killed so far, said IHR, which has been working to assess the death toll despite internet outages and blocks on WhatsApp, Instagram and other online services.London-based Amnesty International said earlier it had confirmed 53 deaths, after Iran's semi-official Fars news agency said last week that \"around 60\" people had died.As Tehran was also battling unrest in the country's southeast, it said five Revolutionary Guards members were killed in clashes Friday in Zahedan, the capital of Sistan-Baluchestan province.The poverty-stricken region has often seen clashes with Baluchi minority rebels, Sunni Muslim extremist groups and drug smuggling gangs.But a Sunni Muslim preacher, Molavi Abdol Hamid, said the community was \"inflamed\" after the alleged rape of a teenage girl by a police officer in the province, in a post on the cleric's website on Wednesday.IHR accused the security forces of the mainly Shiite country of \"bloodily repressing\" the Zahedan protest that erupted after Friday prayers over accusations a police chief in the province's port city of Chabahar had raped a 15-year-old girl from the Sunni Baluch minority.Iran has accused outside forces of stoking the nationwide protests, especially its arch enemy the United States and Washington's Western allies.Iran's intelligence ministry said Friday that nine foreign nationals -- including from France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland -- were arrested \"at or behind the scene of riots\", along with 256 members of outlawed opposition groups.The unrest comes as Iran seeks to revive its 2015 nuclear deal with the United States and other major powers to end sanctions that have throttled its oil-rich economy and seen South Korea, China and Japan freeze billions of dollars in Iranian funds.The landmark Vienna deal -- which had promised sanctions relief in return for strict nuclear controls -- has been in tatters since then US president Donald Trump withdrew from it in 2018 and Iran later backed away from its own commitments.In a rare concession, Iran has allowed a detained Iranian-American, Baquer Namazi, 85, to leave the country and released his son Siamak Namazi, 50, from detention, the United Nations confirmed Saturday.Baquer Namazi is a former UNICEF official who was detained in February 2016 when he went to Iran to press for the release of Siamak, who had been arrested in October of the previous year.Both were convicted of espionage in October 2016 and sentenced to 10 years in prison.Iranian state media said on Sunday that, following the prisoner release, Iran was now awaiting the unfreezing of about $7 billion in funds abroad.\"With the finalisation of negotiations between Iran and the United States to release the prisoners of both countries, $7 billion of Iran's blocked resources will be released,\" said state news agency IRNA.Read | Mahsa Amini's death tragic but chaos unacceptable: Iran president amid raging protests",

    "content": "A revived Hurricane Ian threatened coastal South Carolina and the historic city of Charleston with severe flooding Friday after the deadly storm caused catastrophic damage in Florida and trapped thousands in their homes.Sheets of rain whipped trees and power lines and left many areas on Charleston\u2019s downtown peninsula under water by midday. A popular pier in the beach community of Pawleys Island collapsed and floated away. Ian\u2019s anticipated landfall was expected to coincide with high tide, which would make flooding worse.Ian left a broad swath of destruction after it came ashore on Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast as one of the strongest storms ever to hit the U.S. The storm flooded areas on both of Florida\u2019s coasts, tore homes from their slabs, demolished beachfront businesses and left more than 2 million people without power. At least nine people were confirmed dead in the U.S. \u2014 a number that was almost certain to increase as officials confirm more deaths and search for people.With winds holding at 85 mph (140 kph), the National Hurricane Center\u2019s update at 11 a.m. Friday placed Ian about 60 miles (95 km) southeast of Charleston.ALSO READ: Hurricane Ian wrecks Florida, heads towards Carolinas | PICSThe center\u2019s hurricane warning stretched from the Savannah River to Cape Fear. The forecast predicted a storm surge of up to 7 feet (2.1 meters) into some Carolina coastal areas, and rainfall of up to 8 inches (20 centimeters).In Florida, rescue crews piloted boats and waded through riverine streets Thursday to save thousands of people trapped amid flooded homes and buildings shattered by Hurricane Ian.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Friday that rescue crews had gone door-to-door to over 3,000 homes in the hardest-hit areas.\u201cThere\u2019s really been a Herculean effort,\u201d he said during a news conference in Tallahassee.Climate change added at least 10% more rain to Hurricane Ian, according to a study prepared immediately after the storm, said its co-author, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab climate scientist Michael Wehner.Among those killed were an 80-year-old woman and a 94-year-old man who relied on oxygen machines that stopped working amid power outages, as well as a a 67-year-old man who was waiting to be rescued died after falling into rising water inside his home, authorities said.Officials fear the death toll could rise substantially, given the wide territory swamped by the storm.Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said responders have focused so far on \u201chasty\u201d searches, aimed at emergency rescues and initial assessments, which will be followed by two additional waves of searches. Initial responders who come across possible remains are leaving them without confirming, he said Friday, describing as an example the case of a submerged home.\u201cThe water was up over the rooftop, right, but we had a Coast Guard rescue swimmer swim down into it and he could identify that it appeared to be human remains. We do not know exactly how many,\u201d Guthrie said.ALSO READ | Death toll in Florida uncertain as Hurricane Ian takes aim at CarolinasAt least three people were reported killed in Cuba after the hurricane struck there on Tuesday.In Florida, businesses near Fort Myers Beach were completely razed, leaving twisted debris. Broken docks floated at odd angles beside damaged boats. Fires smoldered on lots where houses once stood.\u201cI don\u2019t know how anyone could have survived in there,\u201d William Goodison said amid the wreckage of a mobile home park where he\u2019d lived for 11 years. Goodison rode out the storm at his son\u2019s house inland.The hurricane tore through the park of about 60 homes, leaving many destroyed or mangled beyond repair, including Goodison\u2019s. Wading through waist-deep water, Goodison and his son wheeled two trash cans containing what little he could salvage \u2014 a portable air conditioner, some tools and a baseball bat.The road into Fort Myers Beach was littered with broken trees, boat trailers and other debris. Cars were abandoned in the road, having stalled when the storm surge flooded their engines.Emergency crews sawed through toppled trees to reach stranded people. Many in the hardest-hit areas were unable to call for help because of electrical and cellular outages.A chunk of the Sanibel Causeway fell into the sea, cutting off access to the barrier island where 6,300 people live.Hours after weakening to a tropical storm while crossing the Florida peninsula, Ian regained strength Thursday evening over the Atlantic. The National Hurricane Center predicted it would hit South Carolina as a Category 1 hurricane Friday, still much weaker than the Category 4 hurricane it was on Wednesday.National Guard troops were being positioned in South Carolina to help with the aftermath, including any water rescues. And in Washington, President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for the state, a needed step to speed federal assist for recovery once Ian passes.In North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper urged residents to prepare for torrents of rain, high winds and potential power outages.ALSO READ | Unwilling or unable to evacuate, some Florida residents ride out Hurricane Ian",

    "content": "US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Sunday he sees no imminent invasion of Taiwan by China but said China was trying to establish a \"new normal\" with its military activities around the island.A visit to Taiwan early in August by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi enraged China, which subsequently launched military drills near the island. Those have continued, although on a much reduced scale.\"I don't see an imminent invasion,\" Austin said in an interview broadcast on CNN.\"What we do see is China moving to establish what we would call a new normal. Increased activity - we saw a number of center line crossings of the Taiwan Strait by their aircraft. That number has increased over time. We've seen more activity with their surface vessels and waters in and around Taiwan.\"The United States and its allies have responded to the drills by continuing to sail through the region. A U.S. Navy warship and a Canadian frigate made a routine transit through the Taiwan Strait on Sept. 20.The United States will continue to work with its allies and partners \"to ensure that we maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific,\" Austin said in an interview on CNN's \"Fareed Zakaria GPS\" that was recorded on Friday.The narrow Taiwan Strait has been a frequent source of military tension since the defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the communists, who established the People's Republic of China.The United States is working to reopen channels of military communication with China, something that is critical to both countries, Austin said.China in August halted cooperation with the United States in a number of areas, including dialogue between senior-level military commanders, in retaliation for Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.Austin said he has communicated by phone and in person with his Chinese counterpart, Defense Minister Wei Fenghe, who agreed that open communications were important.\"We'll do everything we can to continue to signal that we want those channels open and I would hope that China will begin to lean forward a bit more and work with us,\" he said.",

It also ordered Khan to appear in a local court before October 7.Initially, Khan was booked under terrorism laws but the charges were deleted on the directive of the Islamabad High Court and the case was transferred from an anti-terrorism court to a normal sessions court.The bail granted to him by the anti-terrorism case also became ineffective after the case was transferred to sessions court.Police said he failed to attend the last court hearing on the matter and the arrest warrant was issued to ensure his presence.Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah told the Geo News on Saturday that Khan was not being arrested and the arrest warrant was routine and bailable. \u201cIt is [for] a bailable crime.

We will never recognise the results of these sham referendums or any annexation of Ukrainian territory,\u201d said UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly.\u201cThe Russian regime must be held to account for this abhorrent violation of international law. That\u2019s why we are working with our international partners to ramp up the economic pressure through new targeted services bans. What happens in Ukraine matters to us all, and the UK will do everything possible to assist their fight for freedom,\u201d he said.According to the FCDO, the UK is moving in lockstep with international partners and as Russia imports 67 per cent of its services from the sanctioning countries, it will impact access to IT services, advertising services, transactional legal advisory services and auditing services.The UK has also sanctioned Elvira Nabiullina, the Governor of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.

IT consultancy services will also be banned, including designing IT systems and software applications. Alongside the UK\u2019s previous ban on quantum computing exports and computing services, and with over 1,70,000 IT specialists fleeing Russia since the invasion began, these measures will further erode Russia\u2019s ability to maintain technological development with the rest of the world,\u201d it said.The export of almost 700 goods from the UK to Russia are also being banned. The list includes hundreds of goods that are critical for production in Russia\u2019s manufacturing sector, with imports from the UK totalling over GBP 200 million last year. In total, GBP 19 billion worth of UK-Russia trade has been wholly or partially sanctioned, based on official 2021 trade flows.

    "content": "Ukraine on Sunday claimed full control of the eastern logistics hub of Lyman, its most significant battlefield gain from Russia in weeks, providing a potential staging post for further attacks to the east while heaping further pressure on the Kremlin.The stinging setback for Russian President Vladimir Putin was delivered after he proclaimed the annexation of four regions covering nearly a fifth of Ukraine on Friday, an area that includes Lyman. Kyiv and the West have condemned the proclamation as an illegitimate farce.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the capture of the town, where Ukrainian flags were raised over civic buildings on Saturday, demonstrated that Ukraine is capable of dislodging Russian forces and showed the impact Ukraine's deployment of advanced Western weapons was having on the conflict.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday that the success of the country's soldiers was not limited to the recapture of Lyman.Ukraine forces have liberated the small Arkhanhelske and Myrolyubivka settlements in the Kherson region as well, he said.Ukraine's Interfax agency reported that according to Serhiy Cherevatyi, spokesman for the Ukrainian Eastern Group of Forces, Ukraine's forces recaptured Torske, a small village in the Donetsk region, about 15 kilometres (9 miles) east of the now liberated Lyman.Reuters was not able to immediately verify the reports.Russia's defence ministry said on Saturday that it was pulling troops out of the Lyman area \"in connection with the creation of a threat of encirclement\".It did not mention Lyman in its daily update on fighting in Ukraine on Sunday, although it said Russian forces had destroyed seven artillery and missile depots in the Ukrainian regions of Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv and Donetsk.Zelenskiy said the abduction of the director-general of Ukraine's Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is an act of Russian terror.A Russian patrol detained Ihor Murashov on Friday, the state-owned company in charge of the plant said on Saturday, and the International Atomic Energy Agency said Russia had confirmed the move.\"This is another instance of clear act of Russian terror, for which the terrorist state must bear an ever-increasing punishment,\" Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.The Ukrainian military said in its evening statement on Sunday that its forces had repelled Russian advances in several areas - particularly in Donetsk region near Bakhmut and Spirne, just inside Donetsk region near Lysychansk, a major centre in neighbouring Luhansk region.Russian forces had captured Lyman from Ukraine in May and had been using it as a logistics and transport hub for its operations in the north of the Donetsk region. Its recapture by Ukrainian troops is Russia's largest battlefield loss since Ukraine's lightning counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region in September.Control over Lyman could prove a \"key factor\" in helping Ukraine reclaim lost territory in the neighbouring Luhansk region, whose full capture Moscow announced in early July after weeks of grinding advances, Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai said.Lyman's operational importance was due to its command over a road crossing over the Siverskyi Donets River, behind which Russia has been attempting to consolidate its defences, Britain's Ministry of Defence said.Russia likely experienced heavy casualties during the withdrawal, the ministry added. Russia had 5,000 to 5,500 troops in the town before the Ukrainian attack, a Ukrainian military spokesman said on Saturday.The areas Putin claimed as annexed just over seven months into Russia's invasion of its neighbour - Donetsk and Luhansk plus Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south - are equal to about 18% of Ukraine's total surface land area.Russia's parliament is to consider on Monday bills and ratification treaties to absorb the regions, the speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin said.A pomp-filled Kremlin signing ceremony with the regions' Russian-installed leaders on Friday has failed to stem a wave of criticism within Russia of how its military operation is being handled. Britain's defence ministry said that was likely to intensify with further setbacks.Putin ally Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Russia's southern Chechnya region, on Saturday called for a change of strategy \"right up to the declaration of martial law in the border areas and the use of low-yield nuclear weapons.\" Washington says it would respond decisively to any use of nuclear weapons.Other hawkish Russian figures on Saturday criticised Russian generals and Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu on social media for overseeing the setbacks but stopped short of attacking Putin.The United States was \"very encouraged\" by Ukrainian gains, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Sunday, while NATO's Stoltenberg said the fall of Lyman demonstrated the effectiveness of Western weapons in the conflict.\"Allies are stepping up their support to Ukraine and that is the best way to ensure that ... Ukraine is actually able to liberate and retake occupied territory,\" Stoltenberg said in an NBC interview.U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine's presidential office, in Istanbul on Sunday and pledged Washington's steadfast support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, the White House said.Pope Francis on Sunday made an impassioned appeal to Putin to stop \"this spiral of violence and death\" in Ukraine and also called on Zelenskiy to be open to any \"serious peace proposal\".Zelenskiy said on Friday that peace talks with Russia while Putin was still president would be impossible. \"We are ready for a dialogue with Russia, but with another president of Russia,\" he said.",

He is heard as saying: \u201cShah Jee (Qureshi) we have to hold a meeting tomorrow [] you and the three of us (Imran, Qureshi and Azam Khan) and the foreign secretaryIn it [the meeting], we have to tell them to quietly write the minutes of the meeting [] Azam is saying that we should draft the minutes and make photocopies of it.\u201dHere Azam is heard asking, \u201cthis cypher arrived on 7th or 8th [] it came on 8th\u201d, while Imran Khan said that the meeting in Washington was held on the 7th.Also Read: Audio leak about ex-Pak premier Imran Khan discussing 'foreign conspiracy' cypher surfaces\u201cWe don\u2019t have to name the Americans [] under no circumstances do we have to take the name. So on this issue please, the name of the country should not come out of anyone. This is very important for all of you. \u201cThat which country the letter came from [] I don\u2019t want to hear the name from anyone,\u201d the voice believed to be that of Khan says.He also says: \u201cPeople wouldn\u2019t have understood the transcript. You say [things] like this in your jalsa.\u201dThe first clip, which was released on Wednesday, features a conversation between Khan and his then principal secretary Azam Khan about a cypher sent by Pakistan's Ambassador in Washington Asad Majeed about his meeting with a US official.US Assistant Secretary of State for Central and South Asia Donald Lu was the central figure in Khan\u2019s claims about a US-backed regime-change conspiracy.He accused Lu of threatening Pakistan\u2019s former ambassador to the US, Asad Majeed, that a failure to remove Khan through a no-confidence vote would herald \u201cconsequences\u201d for Pakistan and vice versa.Khan was ousted from power in April after losing a no-confidence vote in his leadership, which he alleged was part of a US-led conspiracy targeting him because of his independent foreign policy decisions on Russia, China and Afghanistan.The issue of audio leaks hit social media last week, when a taped conversation between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his principal secretary Tauqeer Shah sent social media into meltdown.Pakistan on Friday appointed an interim foreign secretary after the retirement of Sohail Mahmood as the appointment of the chief diplomat was apparently hit by the \u2018cypher\u2019 controversy\u2019.Meanwhile, a top panel constituted to probe the embarrassing audio leaks from the Pakistan Prime Minister's House on Friday finished combing and debugging the sprawling premises nestled in the foothills of the Margalla here.",

And 23 crore people are earning less than Rs 375 per day. Poverty is a demon-like challenge in front of us. It is important that we put to death this demon,\" Hosabale said, addressing a webinar organised by Sangh affiliate Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM).He blamed the \"faulty' economic policies of the earlier governments for the \"ills\" in the economy.Besides poverty, \"inequality and unemployment are other two challenges need to be addressed\", the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leader said.\"There are four crore unemployed people in the country, 2.2 crore in rural areas and 1.8 crore in urban areas. Labour force survey pegs the unemployment rate at 7.6 per cent... We not only need all-India schemes, but also local schemes for generating employment,\" he said.Hosabale also suggested reviving cottage industries and more initiatives in skill development sector to further increase its penetration in rural areas.On inequality, Hosabale wondered whether it is a good thing that despite being one of the top six economies, half of the country's population has only 13 per cent of the total income.\"....India is among the top six economies of the world. Top one per cent of India's population has one fifth of the nation's income. And at the same time, the country's 50 per cent population gets only 13 per cent of the total income,\u201d he said asking, is this a \"good situation?\"Underlining that there is need to generate jobs at the rural level, Hosabale said with this aim SJM has launched 'Swavalambi Bharat Abhiyan'.He further said through this campaign, the SJM will try to take new initiatives in agriculture and allied sectors, along with providing skill development and marketing at the village level.",

TCS, Tech Mahindra, HCL Tech, L&T, Wipro, and Reliance were among the major losers.IndusInd, PowerGrid, NTPC, SBI, Kotak Bank and HDFC twins advanced.On the domestic front, the wholesale price-based inflation eased for the third consecutive month in August to 12.41 per cent on softening in prices of manufactured items. However, August was the 17th consecutive month of double-digit wholesale price inflation.Global stock markets also declined following overnight losses at Wall Street as higher-than-expected inflation fanned rate hike fears. European benchmarks were marginally lower while Asian markets witnessed steeper losses.The US inflation slowed only to 8.3 per cent in August, instead of the 8.1 per cent economists expected.Germany's DAX lost 0.2 per cent and France's CAC 40 gave up 0.3 per cent while the UK's FTSE 10 shed 0.7 per cent.Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 2.8 per cent, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 2.3 per cent, and the Shanghai Composite index declined 0.8 per cent.Foreign institutional investors pumped in Rs 1,956.98 crore into domestic equities on Tuesday, as per data available with BSE.",

Astronauts who go for long-duration missions to the International Space Station (ISS) have to go through a lot of adjustments when it comes to the biochemistry of the human body. One among them is weightlessness, a condition that makes you feel lighter in space as the impact of gravity ends.To understand the effects this condition has, researchers have turned to Vivaldi, a unique experiment designed by the European Space Agency SciSpacE team and scientists. Located in Toulouse, France, it is one of the only facilities in Europe that can analyse the impact weightlessness has on the human body during space travel.\"Though astronauts exercise and take supplements to mitigate some of these effects, understanding more about deconditioning in microgravity could allow physicians to design better treatments,\" the European Space Agency said in a statement.Also Read | Russia could extend Space Station deal with US till 2028: ReportVivaldi is an experiment that works on dry immersion, which creates analogue conditions on the ground simulating zero gravity effects on the body. The experiment needs the person to be immersed in water for long periods while staying dry. According to the ESA, participants are clothed in a waterproof fabric and laid in specially-designed water baths and are then submerged above the torso, with a fitted waterproof tarp keeping their arms and head above water.The experiment does not last for hours, but for days and participants are subjected to the unique condition for a period of five days, during which they are given meals using the floating board and a neck pillow. For relieving themselves, participants are assisted onto a trolley, maintaining their laid-back position, and temporarily removed from the water by staff.\u201cOur first objective is to use the analogue to get a better understanding of how humans physiologically, and to a certain extent psychologically, react and adapt to such an extreme stimulus,\" Angelique, ESA Discipline Lead for Life Sciences, said in a statement.Also Read | Having nightmares regularly?

Fiercely targeting the countries of the West, the Kremlin leaders said that western countries not only weakened other nations but disintegrated them too.Putin on Friday held a formal ceremony wherein he proclaimed Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia that have been incorporated into Russian territory. \"We will defend our land by all means,\" he said during the event while adding that Russia would 'restore' the infrastructure.Coming down heavily on the countries of the West, he mentioned colonisation and other practices by the western bloc. Referring to India, he said the western colonies carried out the genocide of people, opium wars and the plundering of States which were ruled by then hegemonies.He said that the western countries were aiming to make Russia a 'colony' and condemned the alleged mindset.\"It was back in the middle ages that the West started its colonial regimes. The genocide of the people of America, the plundering of India and Africa, the wars against China, and the opium wars.

    "content": "While world leaders from wealthy countries acknowledge the \u201cexistential threat\u201d of climate change, Tuvalu Prime Minister Kausea Natano is racing to save his tiny island nation from drowning by raising it 13 to 16 feet (4 to 5 meters) above sea level through land reclamation.While experts issue warnings about the eventual uninhabitability of the Marshall Islands, President David Kabua must reconcile the inequity of a seawall built to protect one house that is now flooding another one next door.That is the reality of climate change: Some people get to talk about it from afar, while others must live it every day.Natano and Kabua tried to show that reality on Wednesday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Together they launched the Rising Nations Initiative, a global partnership aimed to preserve the sovereignty, heritage and rights of Pacific atoll island nations whose very existence have been threatened by climate change.Also Read | World leaders pledge more support for nature ahead of UN summitNatano described how rising sea levels have impacted everything from the soil that his people rely on to plant crops, to the homes, roads and power lines that get washed away. The cost of eking out a living, he said, eventually becomes too much to bear, causing families to leave and the nation itself to disappear.\u201cThis is how a Pacific atoll dies,\u201d Natano said. \u201cThis is how our islands will cease to exist.\u201dThe Rising Nations Initiative seeks a political declaration by the international community to preserve the sovereignty and rights of Pacific atoll island countries; the creation of a comprehensive program to build and finance adaptation and resilience projects to help local communities sustain livelihoods; a living repository of the culture and unique heritage of each Pacific atoll island country; and support to acquire UNESCO World Heritage designation.The initiative has already gained the support of countries like the United States, Germany, South Korea and Canada, all of which have acknowledged the unique burden that island nations like Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands must shoulder.Also Read | This is how a rocket launch looks from space with no bordersA U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report released in February spelled out the vulnerability of small island developing states and other global hotspots like Africa and South Asia, whose populations are 15 times more likely to die from extreme weather compared to less vulnerable parts of the world.If warming exceeds a few more tenths of a degree, it could lead to some areas \u2014 including some small islands \u2014 becoming uninhabitable, said report co-author Adelle Thomas of Climate Analytics and the University of the Bahamas. On Wednesday, Natano noted that Tuvalu and its Pacific neighbors \u201chave done nothing to cause climate change,\u201d with their carbon emission contribution amounting to less than .03% of the world\u2019s total.\u201cThis is the first time in history that the collective action of many nations will have made several sovereign countries uninhabitable,\u201d he said.Representatives from other nations who attended Wednesday\u2019s event did not deflect responsibility. But whether they will do enough to turn things around remains to be seen.Several have pledged money to help island nations pay for early warning systems and bring their buildings up to code to better protect them from hurricanes and other weather events. But there was less talk of mitigating the problem of climate change and more about how to adapt to the devastation it has already wrought.\u201cWe see this train coming, and it\u2019s coming down the track, and we need to get out of the way,\u201d said Amy Pope, deputy director general of the International Organization for Migration.Also Read | We have the clearest pictures of Neptune in over 30 years. It has ringsGermany\u2019s climate envoy, Jennifer Morgan, who also attended Wednesday\u2019s event, spoke of her country\u2019s target to reach carbon neutrality by 2045. But while Germany remains committed to phasing out coal as a power source by 2030, it has had to reactivate coal-fired power plants to get through the coming winter amid energy shortages as a result of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.For the president of the Marshall Islands, wealthy nations could be doing much more. During his speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, Kabua urged world leaders to take on sectors that rely on fossil fuels, including aviation and shipping. He pointed to the Marshall Islands\u2019 carbon levy proposal for international shipping that he says \u201cwill drive the transition to zero emission shipping, channeling resources from polluters to the most vulnerable.\u201dU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has likewise encouraged going after the world\u2019s largest polluters. During his opening remarks to the assembly on Tuesday, he pushed for richer countries to tax the profits of energy companies and redirect the funds to both \u201ccountries suffering loss and damage caused by the climate crisis\u201d and those struggling with the rising cost of living.In the meantime, as wealthy countries urge action instead of words in their own U.N. speeches, Kabua, Natano and their fellow island nation leaders will continue to grapple with their daily climate change reality \u2014 and try to continue to exist.Also Read | What happens under a volcano before it explodes?

    "content": "More than seven months after Russia declared war on its neighbour Ukraine, Kremlin started the process of absorbing parts of the war-torn nation. In a not-so-surprising move, President Vladimir Putin on Friday signed treaties annexing occupied Ukrainian regions.With the latest move, Putin has proclaimed Russian rule over 15 per cent of Ukraine, a claim that has received outright rejection from Western countries. This is not the first time Russia has occupied and claimed territories that did not belong to it. Previously, in 2014, Crimea met the same fate.Putin announces formal intergration of 4 provinces of Ukraine into Russia | Moscow controls 15% of Ukraine's territory#IndiaFirst @gauravcsawant pic.twitter.com/OyPq7Fwe1AMeanwhile, in response to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's bid to join the military alliance, Nato said the membership decision requires 'consensus' of allies. Zelenskyy, who has remained firm in his stance to stop Ukraine from falling into Russian hands, had submitted an \u201caccelerated\u201d application to join the Nato military alliance.But Zelenskyy knocking on Nato\u2019s door for help has become an old tune now, with Russia hardly deterred by these moves.Here are the top developments in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war:On Friday, Vladimir Putin signed \u201caccession treaties\u201d, formalising the takeover of four regions in war-torn Ukraine- Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk and Donetsk. At the ceremony held in Moscow, Putin loudly proclaimed that they will \u201cdefend their land\u201d.\"We will defend our land by all means. This is the liberation mission of the Russian people,\" Vladimir Putin said in what appears to be the latest thinly veiled reference to nuclear weapons.Notably, when Kyiv had declared war on Moscow, Vladimir Putin said the military action announced by him will \"demilitarize\" Ukraine and was in response to threats from Ukraine.Shortly after Vladimir Putin signed annexation treaties, Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that his country is submitting an \u201caccelerated\u201d application to join the NATO military alliance.Volodymyr Zelenskyy said \u201cwe are taking our decisive step by signing Ukraine\u2019s application for accelerated accession to Nato.\u201dRussia rained missiles on Ukraine's Kharkiv | Russia intensifies its offensive #IndiaFirst @gauravcsawant #RussiaUkraineWar pic.twitter.com/PLmXTL1l1qThe Ukrainian leader\u2019s NATO application adds another layer of complexity to the seven-month old conflict that rapidly escalated following Putin\u2019s announcement of annexing parts of Ukraine.Zelenskyy also repeated his pledge to retake all Ukrainian territory now held by Russia which he said \u201cfeels our power.\u201d He also said Ukraine is ready for dialogue with Moscow but \u201cwith another president of Russia.\u201dNato membership for Ukraine was one of Russia's stated reasons for invading its pro-Western neighbor in February. Russia has repeatedly stated that it does not want Ukraine to join Nato, the transatlantic alliance created at the start of the Cold War to protect Europe from the Soviet Union.A month into the war with Russia, Zelenskyy had shown willingness not to seek NATO membership in exchange for a cease-fire and the withdrawal of Russian troops and a guarantee of Ukraine's security. However, several rounds of peace talks yielded no positive result.NATO'S RESPONSE TO UKRAINE'S BIDJens Stoltenberg, who is serving as the 13th secretary general of Nato, said,\u201cEvery democracy in Europe has the right to apply for Nato membership and we respect that right. We have repeated that Nato's door remains open and we have demonstrated that over the last years.\"Stoltenberg added, \"Nato allies when they met at the Nato summit in Madrid said so very clearly that we support Ukraine's right to choose its own path, to decide what kind of security arrangements they want to be part of.The decision on membership has to be taken by all 30 allies and we take these decisions by consensus. Our focus now is providing immediate support to help Ukraine defend itself against the brutal Russian invasion.On top of sanctions already levied against Russia following full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the US on Friday adopted even more sanctions after the Kremlin announced formal annexation of four Ukrainian regions.The United States imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia, targeting hundreds of people and companies, including those in Russia's military-industrial complex and lawmakers.The European Union has condemned Russia\u2019s land-grab. In a joint statement, the EU rejected and condemned \u201cthe illegal annexation\u201d of the four regions: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.The EU\u2019s 27 member states said they will never recognize the illegal referendums that Russia organized \u201cas a pretext for this further violation of Ukraine\u2019s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u201dThe UK has also imposed new services and goods export bans on Russia in response to what it termed the \u201cillegal annexation\u201d of four regions of Ukraine after \u201csham referendums\u201d.The services sanctions are designed to target vulnerable sectors of the Russian economy, including IT consultancy, architectural services, engineering services and transactional legal advisory services for certain commercial activities.(With inputs from PTI, AP)",

It could be a cause of concern.Researchers have found that regular bad dreams in middle-aged people could be linked to an increased case of cognitive decline and they could be at a higher risk of developing dementia as they get older. The study investigated the association between self-reported distressing dream frequency and the risk of cognitive decline.Published in the journal EClinicalMedicine, part of the Lancet Discovery Science, the study found that a higher frequency of distressing dreams was linearly and statistically significantly associated with a higher risk of cognitive decline amongst middle-aged adults.The study could reveal new ways and strategies to analyze and screen the mental condition and establish the symptoms of dementia.Also Read | Non-communicable diseases cause nearly three-quarters of deaths in the world: WHO reportDementia in itself is not a single disease, instead, it's a group of diseases that covers a wide range of specific medical conditions, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease. According to the Alzheimer's Association, disorders that are grouped under the general term \u201cdementia\u201d are caused by abnormal brain changes, which trigger a decline in thinking skills, also known as cognitive abilities, severe enough to impair daily life and independent function.It is to be noted that nightmares are common among the general population, and about 5 per cent of adults experience nightmares weekly, while 1240 per cent experience them monthly. Researchers said that the figures are likely even higher when considering bad dreams alongside nightmares.\"Given the ubiquity of bad dreams and nightmares (distressing dreams) in the adult population, it is surprising that their clinical significance remains largely unknown,\" the paper read, adding that the relationship between distressing dreams and clinical outcomes in people with Parkinson's disease (PD), has received increasing attention.Also Read | What precautions to take to avoid dengue?Researchers from the University of Birmingham analysed three studies that tracked 600 middle-aged adults (aged 35 to 64), and 2,600 people aged 79 and older and analysed their sleep quality and brain health.They found that middle-aged people who experienced bad dreams at least once a week were about four times more likely to experience cognitive decline over the next decade than those who rarely had nightmares. The bad dream could be a result of poor sleep quality, which could lead to a buildup of proteins associated with dementia.Lead author Abidemi I. Otaiku told The Guardian that neurodegeneration within the brain\u2019s right frontal lobe makes it harder for people to control their emotions while dreaming, which in turn leads to nightmares. \u201cThe best way to deal with dementia is to prevent it from occurring, and we know that there are several modifiable risk factors poor diet, lack of exercise, smoking, and drinking too much alcohol,\u201d Otaiku said.Also Read | Anxiety, depression, loneliness could increase risk of long Covid",

    "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday blamed the United States and its allies for blowing up the undersea Nord Stream pipelines, raising the temperature in a crisis that has left Europe racing to secure its energy infrastructure and supplies.In a speech to mark the annexation of four Ukrainian regions invaded by Russian forces, Putin offered no evidence for the claim. Russia has previously said the United States would profit from attacks on Europe's energy infrastructure.\"The sanctions were not enough for the Anglo-Saxons: they moved onto sabotage,\" Putin said. \"It is hard to believe but it is a fact that they organised the blasts on the Nord Stream international gas pipelines.\"READ | Explained: Nord Stream gas pipelines leak and a possible 'sabotage'\"They began to destroy the pan-European energy infrastructure,\" Putin said. \"It is clear to everyone who benefits from this. Of course, he who benefits did it.\"Putin's accusation is likely to be strongly resisted by European countries. The United States, which has said it was too early to confirm it was sabotage, has dismissed talk it was responsible.European Union states, once heavily reliant on Russia and now trying to find alternative gas supplies, say they believe leaks were caused by sabotage, but have stopped short of naming anyone. They are racing to secure other energy infrastructure.The Nord Stream pipelines, which were not pumping gas to Europe when the leaks were found but had gas in them, have been flashpoints in an energy standoff between the West and Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, fuelling a cost-of-living crisis.ALSO READ | Nord Stream pipeline leak in Baltic Sea damages marine life, climateThe European Union is still investigating how Russia's Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines burst this week, draining gas into the Baltic Sea off the coast of Denmark and Sweden. Seismologists registered explosions in the area.Gas will continue to pour out of Nord Stream 1 until Sunday, the Danish energy agency said on Friday, though the leak on Nord Stream 2 is expected to cease on Saturday.The pipeline incident has prompted European countries to step up vigilance over other critical infrastructure, which looks suddenly much more vulnerable.Italy, which was an early starter in weaning off Russian supplies, has strengthened naval surveillance and controls on pipelines bringing gas to Italy from the south and east, senior officials told Reuters.That includes the TransMed pipeline, which connects Algeria to Sicily, the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) running from Azerbaijan to Apulia, and the GreenStream connection between Libya and Sicily.Rome also raised its alert on the Trans Austria Gas (TAG) pipeline that brings fuel from the Nordics to the north-east of Italy.Poland's electricity grid operator on Friday meanwhile announced checks on an undersea cable carrying power from Sweden that crosses the damaged Nord Stream pipelines.ALSO READ | Fourth leak found on Nord Stream pipelines, Swedish coast guard saysThere is also heightened focus on the Baltic Pipe, a project that was unveiled this week. A rival to the Nord Stream network, the Baltic Pipe will transport gas to the Danish and Polish markets and end-users in neighbouring countries from October 1.\"The risk to near-term gas flows has risen sharply on fears that further sabotage could occur on critical gas import pipelines,\" said a note from Fitch Solutions, citing the Baltic Pipeline.\"The possibility of additional acts of sabotage on critical infrastructure is a growing risk that would raise the risk of tipping the war into a wider regional conflict.\"Norway, a major Russian rival on gas supplies, will deploy its military to protect oil and gas installations against possible sabotage after warnings of unidentified drone sightings in September.ALSO READ | How Nord Stream pipeline leak is a threat to climateGermany's energy regulator called in a Reuters interview for more protection for critical energy infrastructure.With no gas flowing through Nord Stream for the foreseeable future, European countries are racing to secure more energy supplies and trying to cushion households from an explosion in prices since last year.European Union countries on Friday agreed to impose emergency levies on energy firms' windfall profits and began more fraught talks on imposing a bloc-wide gas price cap.Germany on Thursday unveiled a 200 billion euro relief package for companies and citizens, in what Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government characterised as a forceful response to what it called Russia's \"energy war\" against Europe.ALSO READ | Nord Stream pipeline Leak: What has unfolded so farIn the Netherlands, citizens have started stockpiling wood and coal to save on rocketing gas bills.Poland and the Czech Republic have asked the European Commission to revive a stalled gas pipeline project connecting the two countries.The gas network operators of Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia have also proposed shipping additional natural gas supply pledged by Azerbaijan to Europe.",

    "content": "The recent Supreme Court order banning commercial activities within 500 meters of the Taj Mahal has created a survival issue for thousands of residents of the Taj Ganj area in Agra.Over 400 handicraft shops, eateries, and hotels operate in the Taj Ganj area, which adjoins the Taj Mahal, and the SC order is bound to affect all these businesses which have been declared illegal overnight by this order.To protect their livelihood, the shopkeepers of the Tajganj area formed a committee yesterday, electing Nitin Singh, a renowned tour guide, as its chairman. The committee will challenge the SC order, and demand that the shopkeepers be heard before any decision is taken to ban commercial activity in Taj Ganj.Aslam Khan, a local shopkeeper said that the local MLA and former UP minister Dr. G S Dharmesh, and former MLA Kesho Mehra attended the meeting and assured their assistance to the committee. A decision was made to meet UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath after Dussehra and apprise him of the situation.Answering a question, former MLA Kesho Mehra said he has assured the shopkeeper of providing all documentation about the petition filed by him in 1996 in the Supreme Court on a similar issue, and his assistance in the court case as well.Meanwhile, the Agra Development Authority has started the survey of Tajganj in the process of implementing the SC order. ADA Vice Chairman Charchit Gaur told India Today that the SC order bans all types of commercial activities within a 500-meter radius of the Taj Mahal, and the ADA has been made responsible for the implementation of that order.He said that four teams have been formed to survey the entire affected area. The affected area has been divided into 12 zones and every house and commercial establishment in this area is being recorded.Hindustani Biradari Secretary Ziauddin said that during the Tajganj project, all shopfronts in the Tajganj area had been remodeled as per government guidelines to show uniformity, but now the shopkeepers have decided to remove these signboards and not allow any ADA employee to enter their shops or homes.Agra Tourist Welfare Chamber secretary Vishal Sharma said that in the year 2000, a survey had been conducted within the 500-meter radius of the Taj Mahal jointly by the ADA, ASI, and Agra Municipal Corporation, in which, the details of every house and commercial establishment were recorded, so that any illegal construction or change of property use could be identified immediately. But this report never saw the light of day and was suppressed, resulting in the proliferation of illegal construction in the Taj Ganj area.Now, another survey is being conducted after the Supreme Court became strict, and that could cause law and order issues in the area, as the locals are in no mood to accept their livelihood being uprooted by the ADA.",

But Moscow will not discuss the results of the referendums in the liberated territories,\" Vladimir Putin said in the grand ceremony, adding that people living in these regions have become Russian citizens forever.Vladimir Putin also launched a passionate defence of Russia's action and accused the West of trying to colonise Russia. \"The West makes every effort to preserve the neo-colonial system, which allows it to rob the world and collect tributes from humanity,\" he said.Speaking about the use of nuclear weapons in the newly annexed regions, Putin said the United States is the only country to have used nuclear weapons twice, creating a precedent.",

These propaganda videos showed how happily Uyghurs were living under the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) regime and were repeatedly shared using batch accounts on YouTube.

While engineers managed to get the leaks fixed and to acceptable levels required for launch, there is no clarity on whether Artemis-1 will lift off next week.Nasa is targetting to have a third attempt to launch the Artemis-1 mission to Moon on September 27 and Wednesday's test was aimed to establish the validity of leaks that had been sealed after they popped up during the last two scrubbed attempts. Nasa, however, confirmed that all objectives of the cryogenic demonstration test had been met.\"After encountering a hydrogen leak early in the loading process, engineers were able to troubleshoot the issue and proceed with the planned activities,\" the American space agency said in a statement, adding that, they will evaluate the data from the test, along with the weather and other factors, before confirming readiness to proceed into the next launch opportunity.The day-long demo had barely begun when hazardous hydrogen fuel began escaping at the same place and the same time as before, despite new seals and other repairs. Engineers halted the flow and warmed the lines in hopes of plugging the leak, and proceeded with the test. But the leak persisted before dropping to acceptable levels.

The telescope has revealed the icy giant in a new light, hanging 4.3 billion kilometers away from Earth, at the edge of the Solar System.The telescope has picked up a crisp view of the rings of Neptune, which had last been seen only in pictures taken by the Voyager 2 spacecraft when it conducted a flyby way back in 1989. Since then the Voyager spacecraft is flying in interstellar space, millions of kilometers away from Neptune where Sun's impact ends.\u201cIt has been three decades since we last saw these faint, dusty rings, and this is the first time we\u2019ve seen them in the infrared. Webb\u2019s extremely stable and precise image quality permits these very faint rings to be detected so close to Neptune,\" Heidi Hammel, a Neptune system expert, said in a release with the pictures.Located 30 times farther from the Sun than Earth, Neptune orbits in the remote, dark region of the outer solar system and is so far from Sun that, according to Nasa, high noon on Neptune is similar to a dim twilight on Earth. Neptune is much richer in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium and is characterized as an ice giant due to the chemical makeup of its interior.Also Read | James Webb Telescope damaged in space, science ops pausedThe Webb Telescope used the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) to look at Neptune and the images show the planet to be purple, instead of its hazy blue glow. \"the methane gas so strongly absorbs red and infrared light that the planet is quite dark at these near-infrared wavelengths, except where high-altitude clouds are present,\" Nasa added.Apart from Neptune, the Webb telescope also captured Neptune\u2019s 14 known moons, which dominated the frame in the dark sky. Triton was clearly visible in the observation, which was covered in a frozen sheen of condensed nitrogen reflecting an average of 70 percent of the sunlight that hits it.The new images drop just hours after engineers announced a technical glitch with the spacecraft.

    "content": "Days ahead of the third attempt to launch the ambitious Artemis-1 mission to the Moon, Nasa is set to load fuel on the Space Launch System (SLS) to check the validity of seals placed after leaks were detected in two scrubbed attempts. Both the core stage and upper stage tanks will be filled with fuel with the Orion spacecraft on top of the SLS at the launch pad.The objective of the tanking operation is to assess repair to address the hydrogen leak, load propellants into the rocket\u2019s tanks using the new procedures, conduct the kick-start bleed, and perform a pre-pressurization test.During the tanking operation, engineers will begin filling the mammoth fuel tanks of the SLS with Liquid Hydrogen as per the new regulations which ensure a much slower way to load the fuel. Nasa said that new cryogenic loading procedures and ground automation will transition temperatures and pressures more slowly during tanking to reduce the likelihood of leaks that could be caused by rapid changes in temperature or pressure.The tanking operation will set the stage for the third attempt at launching Artemis-1 on a maiden mission to Moon and beyond. The spacecraft will go nearly 60,000 kilometers beyond the Moon and return. The 42-day journey will set the stage for astronauts to board the spacecraft for future crewed missions to land on the surface of the Moon.Immersive | Artemis-1: A journey to the stars like never before",

    "content": "Saudi Arabia is planning to launch two astronauts to the International Space Station aboard a space capsule from Elon Musk's SpaceX, becoming the latest Gulf nation to strengthen ties with private U.S. space companies, according to three people familiar with the arrangement.The sources, speaking anonymously to discuss the mission's crew before its formal announcement, said the deal was signed privately earlier this year with Houston's Axiom Space, which arranges and manages private missions to space on U.S. spacecraft for researchers and tourists.Under the deal, two Saudi astronauts will ride SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule to the space station for a roughly weeklong stay early next year, the sources said. The Saudis would be the first from their country to go into space aboard a private spacecraft.Also Read | What happens under a volcano before it explodes? Scientists look insideAxiom had no immediate comment. Officials with the Saudi Space Commission, Riyadh's space agency founded in 2018, were not immediately available to comment.Private U.S. companies have increasingly played a key role in sending astronauts to the space station as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the U.S. space agency now focusing heavily on returning humans to the moon, looks to commercialize the United States' decades-old human spaceflight presence in low-Earth orbit.The deal would mark the latest that puts companies like Axiom in a unique role of diplomacy long dominated by government agencies like NASA. The space station is a football field-sized laboratory some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth that has housed international crews of astronauts for over 20 years.The Saudi astronauts will join two previously announced Americans, retired NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson and race car driver and investor John Shoffner, the sources said. The mission, called Ax-2, will be the second spaceflight arranged by Axiom.Also Read | Nasa's Dart mission takes heavenly route to intentionally crash on asteroidThe private astronauts aboard Ax-2 have yet to be approved by a NASA-chaired panel of the space station's participating stakeholders and countries, such as Russia, Canada, Japan and the European Space Agency, a U.S. official said. The official added that the mission is likely to receive approval.For Axiom and other space companies, cutting deals with foreign governments is seen as vital to sustaining a business centered on putting people in space. Putting people into space is a luxury for wealthy adventure seekers and a source of national prestige and inspiration for aspiring space powers like Saudi Arabia.Axiom launched its first private mission to the space station in April, sending a four-man crew to the space station aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule that included a Canadian investor and an Israeli businessman.Also Read | James Webb Telescope damaged in space, science ops pausedAnd Axiom on Monday announced a deal with Turkey to launch the country's first two astronauts into space in late 2023. That will likely be for mission Ax-3, according to a person familiar with the flight.Axiom's astronaut flight business is crucial experience for the company's broader goals of deploying its own private space station by mid-decade. It plans to first attach modules to the ISS before splitting off into a fully private structure once the existing international laboratory is retired around 2030.The value of Axiom's Saudi agreement was not clear. Each Crew Dragon seat on Axiom's first mission sold for $55 million each.Also Read | Nasa to load fuel on Moon rocket today in key test to check leaks ahead of launch",

    "content": "Pope Francis for the first time directly begged Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop the \"spiral of violence and death\" in Ukraine, saying on Sunday that the crisis was risking a nuclear escalation with uncontrollable global consequences.In an address dedicated to Ukraine and made to thousands of people in St. Peter's Square, Francis also condemned Putin's latest annexation of parts of Ukraine as being against international law. He urged Putin to think of his own people in the event of an escalation.One Vatican official said the impassioned address was so sombre it was reminiscent of a radio peace appeal by Pope John XXIII in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis.It was the first time Francis, who has often condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the death and destruction it has caused, had made such a direct personal appeal to Putin.Saying he was haunted by \"rivers of blood and tears that have been spilled in these months,\" Francis also called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to be open to any \"serious peace proposal\".He was making an urgent appeal \"in the name of God\" for an end to the conflict and said it was \"absurd\" that the world was risking a nuclear conflict.\"My appeal goes above all to the president of the Russian Federation, begging him to stop this spiral of violence and death, even out of love for his own people,\" Francis said.\"On the other side, pained by the enormous suffering of the Ukrainian population following the aggression it suffered, I address an equally hopeful appeal to the president of Ukraine to be open to a serious peace proposal,\" he said.Francis later tweeted both the appeals to the two leaders in Russian and Ukrainian.Speaking two days after Putin proclaimed the annexation of nearly a fifth of Ukraine and placed the regions under Russia's nuclear umbrella, Francis also emphasised all countries' right to \"sovereign and territorial integrity\".Kyiv and its Western allies have condemned Putin's annexations as illegal, and Zelenskiy has said his forces will continue their fight to recapture all Ukrainian territory occupied by Russian forces.Ukraine on Sunday claimed full control of the eastern logistics hub of Lyman, Kyiv's most significant battlefield gain in weeks.\"I strongly deplore the grave situation that has been created in the last few days, with more actions that are contrary to the principles of international law,\" he said in a clear reference to the annexation.\"This, in fact, increases the risk of an nuclear escalation to the point of fearing uncontrollable and catastrophic consequences on a global level,\" he said.In a reference to ethnic Russians living in Ukraine, Francis said it was also necessary to respect \"the rights of minorities and (their) legitimate worries\".Francis said it was \"anguishing\" that the world was learning about Ukrainian geography through names of places such as Bucha, Irpin, Mariupol, Izium, Zaporizhzhia and other places where people had suffered \"indescribable suffering and fear\".",

    "content": "Ever wondered what really propels the magma to be thrown so violently from a volcano into the air and then all across the surface? Scientists have now looked inside the volcano to trace the origin and the journey of the magma and revealed unique details about the churning happening under the surface of the planet.Scientists at the University of Cambridge have studied the chemistry of lavas and volcanic gases almost as they erupted, creating a real-time picture of the churnings under the surface before the volcano erupts. They found that these eruptions are fed by complex plumbing systems.The findings have been published in the journal Nature, which is based on the analysis of volcanic activity on Iceland\u2019s Reykjanes peninsula that exploded in 2021. The study presents unique insights into processes occurring in the volcano based on geochemical studies and analysis of basalts that erupted during the first 50days of the eruption.The Fagradalsfjall eruption on the Reykjanes Peninsula in Iceland in 2021 was unusual as it came after centuries of lull and the magma was supplied from a deep reservoir originating around 15 kilometres beneath the surface, at the base of Earth\u2019s crust. The team analysed not just the magma from the eruption but also details of gas emissions.Also Read | 'Our world is in peril': Polluters must pay, says UN chief pointing to climate crisisThey found that during the initial days of the explosion, the magma was travelling around the boundary between the crust and underlying mantle the thick, rocky layer that makes up most of Earth\u2019s interior. However, as the days progressed, the source changed to greater depths.\u201cEver since Enlightenment thinkers started writing about volcanoes, scientists have drawn cross-sections to visualise how they might work below ground. This study draws together different strands of information from monitoring the chemistry of lava and gas emissions to describe what is happening up to 20 kilometres down,\u201d co-author of the study, Professor Clive Oppenheimer, from Cambridge\u2019s Department of Geography said.Also Read | James Webb Telescope damaged in space, science ops pausedThey analysed magnesium content in the magma and carbon dioxide levels in the volcanic gases to establish that the eruption was fed by something like a high-speed train direct to the mantle.\u201cWe\u2019ve known for a while that magma coming from the mantle is variable. But we\u2019ve had to work hard to find clues as to how this complex mixing happens,\u201d Professor John Maclennan from Cambridge\u2019s Department of Earth Sciences said. The research confirms that new magma can flow into a deep reservoir and mix with existing magma rapidly, in as little as 20 days.Also Read | Nasa to load fuel on Moon rocket today in key test to check leaks ahead of launch",

If you want to show your resistance to defending Taiwan now, if burning the flag is extreme, what will you do when the artillery fire comes?\"The party lost its only member of parliament last year after he was voted out in a recall election.China considers Taiwan to be part of the People's Republic, over the strenuous objections of the government in Taipei, which says Beijing has no right to claim it or speak for the Taiwanese people.",

It used its Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for Optical navigation (DRACO) to snap distant stars and planets to chart a course to its destination.Nasa released an image of Jupiter with its four moons clicked by the Dart mission that was necessary to support ongoing spacecraft testing and rehearsals in preparation for the spacecraft\u2019s kinetic impact into Dimorphos.

    "content": "The hashtag \u201cChinaCoup\u201d was one of the biggest stories last week. We at India Today broke it down in parts as to how baseless rumours ruled the charts across social media sites concerning Xi Jinping\u2019s supposed house arrest to clearance of airspace across Beijing to what not. In part two of the story, we delve into the origination of the trends and how the story received a worldwide focus.This is a typical case of how social media and the internet can aid in spreading fake news or disinformation, creating global waves. Practically speaking, a military coup in China will turn the world upside down. The markets will crash. Geopolitical alignments will change. Diplomatic missions will be working 24x7. It will bring political turmoil within China. We saw high-profile accounts on social media sharing. False, unverified information with utmost conviction. This even included \u201cPulitzer Prize\u201d winners!READ | Social media abuzz with rumour of coup in Beijing against Xi JinpingIt also tells you, unlike other countries, China is opaque. While it may take a max of a few hours to verify a covert military coup in another part of the world, the China coup rumours practically went around for two full days before it was scuttled.Multiple observers, including Drew Thompson, who is a former Department of Defense official responsible for China, Taiwan and Mongolia and is now based in Singapore, traced the origination of the rumour to one Zhao Lanjian (not to be confused with Zhao Lijian, who is the Deputy Director of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Information Department).Zhao Lanjian is supposed to be based in New York and regularly contributes articles to the New Tang Dynasty TV. It is important to note that the New Tang Dynasty network was founded in 2001 by the adherents of the Falun Gong new religious movement with its base in New York. They routinely critique abuses of power by the Chinese Communist Party.The claimed source of the information is an \u201cinvestigative journalist\u201d named Zhao Lanjian who tweeted that 60% of China\u2019s flights have been cancelled, which is an indication of a coup.@ELuttwak might agree that flight cancellations are not the opening phase of a coup.Naturally, this was then picked up by the New Tang Dynasty TV and soon became trending. Adding credence to this, multiple, highly followed Chinese observers, including YouTuber Jennifer Zeng, added other pieces of information, like the empty airspace over China and the movement of military vehicles etc (refer to part 1 of this story) to make this sound credible. One of the stories published by the New Tang Dynasty TV was about the disappearance of Xi Jinping and the rumours around his house arrest.Aside from false reporting of the coup rumours, social media too played a huge role in spreading misinformation at lightning speed. Dr David Spencer, who is a communications lecturer at the University of Canberra shared his Gephi visualizations and findings of the tweet analysis and spoke exclusively to India Today.READ | Was there a massive cancellation of flights in China and empty airspace over Beijing?He analysed close to 100k tweets, over 48 hours from 50K Twitter handles and identified the prominent accounts which were discussing this topic.\u201cThe most important factor that made this an interesting example of the spread of unsubstantiated rumour was that although some reported false events as facts, many of the tweets contributed to the spread, intentionally or not, didn't make outright false claims. Instead, the claims were couched as speculation - saying this is rumored to be happening, or that it's unclear what's going on. Nonetheless, these tweets spread the rumours further. The false narrative travelled as much by doubt and speculation as by overtly false claims. Of course, where this is deliberate, it provides plausible deniability that anyone is intending to seed social media with false reports.\u201dHe also feels credible handles, even if inadvertently talking about the topic, add a lot of weight to the spread of rumours. \u201cA common pattern was that credible sources inadvertently provide material and give weight to 'fake news\u2019, through no fault of their own, just with reports that are adjacent to the false narrative. This credible material is exploited by less credible sources seeking to disseminate untruths.\u201dALSO READ | How strong is Xi Jinping\u2019s position in today\u2019s China?\u201cJennifer Zeng, who posted the first tweet on this rumour, is a relatively prominent Youtuber in addition to having a following on Twitter. She writes regularly for Epoch Times, a significant force in global media explicitly critical of China's government - it's arguably that publication's raison d'\u00eatre. Epoch Times was also an early contributor to the dissemination of the rumour on Twitter,\u201d he added.Atandra Ray (an OSINT) also carried out similar investigations into the Twitter trends and feels given the India-China border disputes, \u201ca lot of accounts originating from India contributed to the amplifying of the Coup Rumour tweets\u201d.There were also other handles from across the globe which just used the #ChinaCoup hashtags to amplify their tweets on a different topic. These are just tweets which try to amplify their impressions using the trending hashtags.Coming back to the point we made at the top of China being an opaque land with respect to its political and military structure, it cannot be disputed that Xi Jinping is facing a lot of Anti-Incumbency and is facing some pressure from his fellow party men. While he was out resting or quarantining himself after the SCO summit, his disappearance from the public eye just for a few days brought a whole suite of rumour mongering.A British journalist who works in Beijing spoke out of anonymity saying it is more likely that Xi Jinping will face pressures from within his own party and the group of ministers, rather than face a coup from the military. The CCP remains strong as ever when it comes to politics, and it is just the top leadership that may face resistance from the others.It is very much the actual o ground situation, captured ever so well by Ankit Kumar for India Today on how Xi Jinping controls his party and the army and why it is virtually impossible to stage a coup against the top leader.ALSO READ | China President Xi Jinping reappears on state TV amid rumours over 'absence' ",

    "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin was set to host a Kremlin ceremony on Friday annexing four regions of Ukraine, while his Ukrainian counterpart said Putin would have to be stopped for Russia to avoid the most damaging consequences of the war.There was a warning too from United Nations chief Antonio Guterres, who said the planned annexations were a \"dangerous escalation\" and jeopardise prospects for peace.Putin has doubled down on the invasion he ordered in February despite suffering a major reversal on the battlefield this month and discontent in Russia over a widely criticised \"partial mobilisation\" of thousands more men to fight in Ukraine. Russia calls the war in Ukraine a \"special operation.\"\"The cost of one person in Russia wanting to continue this war is that Russian society will be left without a normal economy, a worthwhile life, or any respect for humanitarian values,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a Thursday evening address.ALSO READ | Russians paying a bomb to get on private planes to flee after war mobilisation\"It can still be stopped. But to stop it we have to stop that person in Russia who wants war more than life. Your lives, citizens of Russia,\" said Zelenskiy, who earlier spoke of Ukraine delivering a \"very harsh\" reaction to Russian recognition of so-called referendum results.Moscow plans annexation of eastern and southern provinces after what Ukraine and Western countries said were sham votes staged at gunpoint in Russian-occupied areas of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. The territory Russia controls amounts to more than 90,000 square km, or about 15% of Ukraine's total area - equal to the size of Hungary or Portugal.Putin took the intermediary step of signing decrees on Thursday paving the way for occupied regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia to be formally annexed into Russia. The decrees were made public by the Kremlin.Zelenskiy promised a strong response to the annexations and summoned his defence and security chiefs for an emergency meeting on Friday where \"fundamental decisions\" will be taken, an official said.On the eve of the planned ceremony in the Georgievsky Hall of the Great Kremlin Palace and a concert in Red Square, Putin said that \"all mistakes\" made in a call-up announced last week should be corrected, his first public acknowledgment that it had not gone smoothly.Thousands of men have fled Russia to avoid a draft that was billed as enlisting those with military experience and required specialities but has often appeared oblivious to individuals' service record, health, student status or even age.Russia says the referendums, ostensibly asking people in the four regions whether they wanted to be part of Russia, were genuine and showed public support.ALSO READ | India is on the side of peace: Jaishankar on Russia-Ukraine war at UNGAAt Friday's event, Putin will give a speech, meet leaders of the self-styled Russian-backed Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LNR) as well as the Russian-installed leaders of the parts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia that Russian forces occupy.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did not say whether Putin would attend the Red Square concert, as he did a similar event in 2014 after Russia proclaimed it had annexed Ukraine's Crimea region.A stage has been set up on the Moscow square with giant video screens and billboards proclaiming the four areas part of Russia.\"Any decision to proceed with the annexation ... would have no legal value and deserves to be condemned,\" United Nations Secretary General Guterres told reporters.U.S. President Joe Biden said the United States would never recognise Russia's claims on Ukraine's territory, denouncing the referendums. \"The results were manufactured in Moscow,\" Biden said at a conference of Pacific Island leaders on Thursday.Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan pressed Putin in a call to take steps to reduce tensions in Ukraine.Russian government officials have said that the four regions will fall under Moscow's nuclear umbrella once they have been formally incorporated into Russia. Putin has said he could use nuclear weapons to defend Russian territory if necessary.Washington and the European Union are set to impose additional sanctions on Russia over the annexation plan, and even some of Russia's close traditional allies, such as Serbia and Kazakhstan, say they will not recognise the move.What Russia is billing as a celebration comes after Moscow has faced its worst setbacks of the seven-month-old war, with its forces routed in Ukraine's northeast Kharkiv region.Heavy fighting continues in the four disputed regions, particularly Donetsk and Luhansk.\"Our situation (in Luhansk region) is more difficult than in the Kharkiv region. There is no effect of surprise here,\" Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said on Thursday. \"They (the Armed Forces of Ukraine) are advancing. And I hope we will receive very positive news in the near future.\"Some military experts say Kyiv is poised to deliver another major defeat, gradually encircling the town of Lyman, Russia's main remaining bastion in the northern part of Donetsk province.\"The most difficult area for us remains (Lyman). Allied forces are holding their ground. And given that reinforcements will be coming, I believe we will make a breakthrough there,\" Denis Pushilin, leader of the separatist Donetsk People's Republic, said on Telegram.",

    "content": "India vice-captain KL Rahul said he was surprised when he was adjudged the Player of the Match in the 2nd of.a 3-match T20I series against South Africa in Guwahati on Sunday. Rahul said Suryakumar Yadav deserved the recognition for his 22-ball 61, saying the whirlwind knock in the middle-overs made a more significant impact on India's 16-run win in a high-scoring game wherein more than 450 runs were scored.India had more than one significant contributor with the bat as the World N0.1 T20I side flaunted its firepower. KL Rahul, who hit a patient 51 in the first T20I, was at his imperious best, smashing 4 sixes and 5 boundaries for his 27-ball 58.Rahul proved criticism about his strike rate wrong by going after the highly-rated South African pace attack from the word go after Temba Bavuma won the toss and opted to field. Rahul struck at 203 and looked set for a big total but he was trapped LBW by Keshav Maharaj, who was the lone bowler who was able to make an impact on a high-scoring pitch on Sunday.After a 98-run opening stand, Suryakumar Yadav took over, sending the South African bowlers on a leather hunt. Suryakumar hit 5 sixes and 5 boundaries as he tore into the bowling unit. Suryakumar and Virat Kohli stitched a 100-plus match-winning stand for the 3rd wicket as India posted a record total of 237 on the board.\"I am surprised I am getting the Man of the Match award, Surya should have gotten it. He changed the game. Having batted in the middle order, I have realized that it is difficult. DK doesn't always get too many balls to face, and he was phenomenal, and so were Surya and Virat,\" KL Rahul said after India's 16-run win.KL Rahul had been criticised for his strike rate and inability to bat at a sustained high tempo ever since he returned from a long injury layoff at the Asia Cup. Rahul looked rusty even in the home series against Australia but the star batter spent time out in the middle in Thiruvananthapuram in difficult batting conditions.Rahul said he is happy that he was able to adapt to different conditions against South Africa in the lead-up to the World Cup.\"It does (feel satisfying). It is important as an opener to understand what is required on a day and give it your best. It is the mindset I have always played in and will continue to do the same. Satisfying to test yourself in different conditions,\" Rahul added.India scripted their first-ever series victory over South Africa at home in T20Is. The two teams will play the final match of the series in Indore on Tuesday, October 4.",

    "content": "How often have you felt low on a Monday morning? Monday blues is when a person has feelings of negativity or goes through mental exhaustion at the start of the week. However, medical experts share that the concept, though not a clinical term, is now a part of a larger subject of mental health.Dr. Samir Parikh, Psychiatrist and the Director of the Department of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences, Fortis Healthcare, explains the concept of Monday blues in today\u2019s day and age wherein working professionals have a \u201chectic routine\u201d even during the weekends.\u201cWhen a young child a couple of days to adjust to a structural routine as opposed to their relaxed schedule when they were at home for two months during summer vacation, this is a similar feeling that working adults go through when they go back to work on Monday,\u201d says Dr. Samir Parikh.This means that a transition of the mind is taking place, where one has to come out of the comfort zone to a more challenging environment, he adds. Monday blues is mostly associated with a person\u2019s lack of \u201cbreaks\u201d from work, who is ultimately unable to cope with their stress and experiences mental exhaustion, mostly because they may have had a working weekend.\u201cA lot of people, day in and day out, tend to have hectic routines and take their work home. They don't get space to relax and that's why their mind is busy evaluating a working weekend,\u201d says Dr Parikh.However, on a Friday, the mind is looking forward to the respite they will have during the weekend that gets trampled when one is taking work home. \u201cInvariably, Monday tends to be a bit more hectic also because of interactions, meetings, Friday handovers etc., which makes it a heavier day than the rest of the week. Both these concepts - the perception of when the week is starting and the respite - are typically why people experience Monday blues,\u201d he says.Dr Parikh shares the following tips on how one can avoid experiencing Monday blues and balance the week out.- Avoid reaching that breaking point or the point when you feel over-stressed or overworked.- Try and have a light or somewhat similar day in the middle of the week.- Ensure there are days during the week when you have enough time for yourself. You have to give yourself a break and feel relaxed between working days.- Try and finish your work regularly so you don't have any spillover for the next day or the next week.- On weekends, spend it as you like but do not change your sleep-awake pattern. Disturbing your biological clock can cause Monday blues.- It is the quality of your working week, as in how you're able to give yourself respite, enough joyful moments, and enough breaks that eventually decides how you are able to feel throughout the week. If your quality of work is relaxed and balanced, Monday blues won\u2019t exist.- If you do experience Monday blues every week, try and start your work on time.- Listen to music on your commute to work.- Get some social stimulation before Monday by talking to your colleagues a day before.- Ensure, at least on Monday, that you don't carry work home at the end of the day.",

It witnessed an intra-day high of 79.47 and a low of 79.66 during the session.It finally ended at 79.57, up 12 paise from its previous close of 79.69.\"The key catalyst driving the Indian rupee higher has been the steep decline in crude oil prices wherein they have slipped to a 7-month low while hovering around the USD 90 a barrel mark,\" Sugandha Sachdeva, Vice-President - Commodity and Currency Research, Religare Broking Ltd.Every USD 10 a barrel fall in crude prices leads to inflation inching lower by around 25 bps and also reduces our import bill significantly which bode well for the economy as well as the Indian rupee.The dollar index has also retreated from two-decade highs following a super-sized rate hike of 75 bps by the ECB and its hawkish stance, which is further supporting the local unit.The \"risk on\" sentiments and strong gains in domestic equities are favouring a positive bias for the rupee-dollar exchange rate.\"The Indian rupee has witnessed a lot of resilience around the key 80.10 mark over the last couple of days, from where it has reversed course, and now seems to witness appreciation in coming days towards the 79.20 mark,\" Sachdeva said.According to Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, in line with the stronger regional currencies following the broad-based weakness in the greenback, the rupee opened higher and managed to clock the second weekly gains.\"The ICE dollar index, a basket of the six currencies, fell more than a percentage point and is on track for its biggest daily drop in about a month. The verbal interventions from Japanese officials and hawkish commentary from ECB officials dragged the dollar lower,\" Parmar said.Moreover, strength in domestic equities backed by foreign fund inflows, stronger high-frequency data and long unwinding in the dollar supported the local unit.Spot USDINR is expected to trade in the range of 79.20 to 80 in the near-term.The dollar index, which measures the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, fell 0.98 per cent to 108.63.Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, advanced 1.72 per cent to USD 90.68 per barrel.The rupee appreciated on positive domestic equities and a weak US dollar. The dollar declined by more than 1 per cent on a sharp bounce amid an unprecedented 75 bps rate hike by ECB to 1.25 per cent, said Anuj Choudhary - Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.\"Global inflationary pressures may also put pressure on riskier assets. However, weakness in dollar and positive cues from global markets may support Rupee at lower levels,\" Choudhary said, adding, \"USD-INR spot price is expected to trade in a range of Rs 79 to Rs 80.30 in the next couple of sessions.\"On the domestic equity market front, the BSE Sensex ended 104.92 points or 0.18 per cent higher at 59,793.14, while the broader NSE Nifty gained 34.60 points or 0.19 per cent to 17,833.35.",

    "content": "Located 1,50,000 kilometers away from Earth, the James Webb Space Telescope is a marvel of engineering, but it remains vulnerable to the harsh space environment. The spacecraft has now run into a new technical difficulty after an issue was observed with its Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI).Nasa has noted a mechanism that supports one of the four modes of the instrument known as Medium-Resolution Spectroscopy (MRS) to display technical glitches. The medium-resolution spectroscopy showed increased friction during setup for a science observation on August 4.Following the anomaly, Nasa conducted preliminary health checks and investigations into the issue and an anomaly review board was formed on September 6 to assess the next step to resume normal function. However, till then, the Webb team has paused scheduling observations using this particular observing mode.The mechanism, which has developed issues, is a grating wheel that allows scientists to select between short, medium, and longer wavelengths when making observations using the MRS mode. The Webb team is now analyzing the behavior of the observatory and is currently developing strategies to resume MRS observations as soon as possible.Also Read | Nasa to load fuel on Moon rocket today in key test to check leaks ahead of launch\"The observatory is in good health, and MIRI\u2019s other three observing modes imaging, low-resolution spectroscopy, and coronagraph are operating normally and remain available for science observations,\" the European Space Agency said in a statement.The Mid-InfraRed Instrument is a suit of instruments that covers the mid-infrared wavelength range from 5 to 28.3 microns, giving the telescope the ability to look into the infrared. MIRI is used to produce mid-infrared images and spectra with an unprecedented combination of sharpness and sensitivity.Also Read | Isro successfully tests new motor that could power future launch vehiclesThis is not the first time that the telescope has reported damage, the $10 billion observatory sustained a micrometeoroid impact during the final phases of commissioning ahead of beginning science operations. Nasa had said that between May 23 and 25 the James Webb Space Telescope sustained an impact on one of its primary mirror segments.However, the spacecraft had been performing optimally, looking at the edge of time with its deep field view wowing the world. Webb's mirror was engineered to withstand bombardment with dust-sized particles flying at extreme velocities in space.The mirrors have been designed with a mixture of simulations and actual test impacts on mirror samples to get a clearer idea of how to fortify the observatory for operation in orbit.Also Read | How many ants are there on Earth?

    "content": "Emergency crews tried on Thursday to reach stranded Florida residents as a resurgent Hurricane Ian veered toward the Carolinas after cutting a path of destruction across Florida, leaving behind deadly floodwaters, downed power lines and widespread damage.Ian, one of the strongest storms ever to hit the U.S. mainland, flooded Gulf Coast communities and knocked out power to millions before plowing across the peninsula to the Atlantic Ocean, where it regained strength ahead of another anticipated landfall in South Carolina on Friday afternoon.Florida's death toll remained uncertain amid scattered reports of casualties. At an evening news briefing, Governor Ron DeSantis acknowledged some people had perished but warned against speculating before official confirmation.ALSO READ | Hurricane Ian looks furious from space as Category-3 storm hits Cuba\"We fully expect to have mortality from this hurricane,\" he said.President Joe Biden, speaking earlier at Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) headquarters in Washington, said Ian could prove to be the deadliest in state history.\"The numbers are still unclear, but we're hearing early reports of what may be substantial loss of life,\" Biden said.In hard-hit Charlotte County, a spokesperson for the sheriff's department confirmed multiple deaths but did not have a firm figure. Authorities in Sarasota County were investigating two possible storm-related deaths, a sheriff's spokesperson said.A 72-year-old man in Deltona in central Florida died after he went outside during the storm to drain his pool, authorities said.More than 2.3 million homes and businesses in Florida remained without power, according to tracking website PowerOutage.us.Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina were bracing for impact as Ian - which weakened to a tropical storm during its trek across Florida - returned to hurricane strength by 5 p.m. ET (2100 GMT) after moving into the Atlantic Ocean, with maximum sustained wind speeds of 75 miles per hour (120 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.The storm was forecast to make landfall again about 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) on Friday north of Charleston. A hurricane warning was in effect for hundreds of miles of coastline from the South Carolina-Georgia border north to Cape Fear, North Carolina.Ian was expected to bring potential life-threatening storm surges and possible tornadoes to the region on Friday, the National Weather Service said.In South Carolina, Mercedes Benz (MBGn.DE), Boeing Co (BA.N), and the seaports that support manufacturers will suspend operations on Friday.Charleston is particularly at risk, according to a city-commissioned report released in November 2020, which found about 90% of all residential properties were vulnerable to storm surge flooding.North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper urged residents to \"take necessary precautions,\" warning of possible flooding, landslides and tornadoes.\"This storm is still dangerous,\" Cooper said.Ian blasted ashore in Florida at the barrier island of Cayo Costa on Wednesday afternoon as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 150 miles per hour (241 kph).The storm transformed Florida's southwestern shoreline, dotted with sandy beaches, coastal towns and mobile home parks, into a disaster zone as Ian swept seawater into waterfront homes.Sanibel Island, a popular vacation destination, was hit hard, and the only bridge leading to the island was impassable, hampering rescue and aid efforts, said DeSantis, who viewed the devastation from the air earlier on Thursday. Fort Myers Beach also suffered significant damage, the governor said.There had been at least 700 confirmed rescues as of Thursday evening, DeSantis said. Most schools will reopen on Friday or Monday.Throughout the day, residents in areas like Venice, in Sarasota County about 75 miles (120 km) south of Tampa, hunted for family and friends while rescue crews worked to reach people trapped in flooded homes.The search for loved ones was made more difficult as cellphone services were often cut.\"A lot of downed trees, a lot of flooding everywhere. We are trying to get a hold of my daughter,\" said Terri Byrd, as she tried to get cell service in a Walmart parking lot after spending the night at a Venice elementary school.In Punta Gorda, directly in the hurricane's path, trees, debris and power lines covered roadways, though many buildings withstood the storm's onslaught better than feared.\"It was insane,\" local landscaper Jeffrey Chambers, 53, said, describing sideways rain that erased all visibility. \"I was like 'Please stop already, just stop.' And it kept going and going.\"Brenda Siettas, 62, a paraprofessional who works with students, was in the city in 2004 when Hurricane Charley blasted much of her neighborhood away. Buildings constructed since then are more able to survive high winds, she said.\"They definitely built back much better since Charley,\" she said. \"Back then I stayed here for two weeks: no power, no water, no sewer.\"Biden spoke to DeSantis on Thursday, and FEMA Director Deanne Criswell will be in Florida on Friday. Biden said that he will travel to the state when conditions allow.He also approved a disaster declaration, making federal resources available to the counties impacted by the storm.",

    "content": "In a series that ebbed and flowed, England had the last laugh, winning a 7-match series 4-3 against Pakistan on their first trip to the Asian country in 17 years. In a crunch series decider in Lahore, England posted 209 for 3 and then went on to defend the total, restricting Pakistan for 142 for 9 in 20 overs.In the crunch series decider, Pakistan's T20I batting stalwarts Mohammad Rizwan and Babar Azam failed to get going.Pakistan vs England, 7th T20I highlightsBabar Azam fell for just 4 as early as the first over to Chris Woakes while Reece Topley got the big wicket of Mohammad Rizwan for 1 in the second over. Pakistan\u2019s chase looked done and dusted in just 9 balls as they were left reeling at 5 for 2 after losing their captain and their best T20I batter.Pakistan\u2019s middle order has been a serious cause of concern and it was put to test early after Babar and Rizwan failed.Shaan Masood got a much-needed 56 off 43 balls but it was the only significant contribution as Pakistan kept losing wickets at regular intervals to get restricted to 142 for 8 in 20 overs.Iftikhar Ahmed and Khushdil Shah who are under the scanner for their inconsistent run in the middle-order managed just 19 runs and 27 runs. Asif Ali got out for just 7 runs and lower-order big-hitter Mohammad Nawaz couldn\u2019t get going in the crunch game.Pakistan never had any kind of momentum during the chase as England proved yet again that they are going to be one of the favourites for the T20 World Cup title in Australia.For England, Chris Woakes shone with figures of 3/26 in 4 overs while David Willey picked up 2 wickets, giving away just 22 runs.Earlier on Sunday, England flaunted their batting might with Philip Salt and Alex Hales getting off to a flyer, posting 39 runs in just 4 overs. Mohammad Hasnain picked up the wicket of Hales and Salt was run-out but David Malan and Ben Duckett stitched a 62-run stand to put England ahead.Malan hit 3 sixes and 8 boundaries for his 47-ball 78 while Harry Brook hit 4 sixes and a boundary in a late overs blitz to finish with 29-ball 46.",

    "content": "When Khushboo Singh, 37, and her husband Shubham Tandon, 39, decided to go for a bigger car four years ago as a replacement for their Maruti Swift, they chose a Renault Duster SUV. It served the couple, then based in Gurugram, well, since it gave them ample space to accommodate their two pet golden retrievers and other close relatives when they went on long drives. The couple, who moved to Pune earlier this year, as Tandon got a job with the city-based Bajaj Finserv, decided to upgrade to a Hyundai Alcazar, a seven-seater that cost them Rs 25 lakh, since the dogs needed more space as they grew up. They paid for the car, delivered to them in August-end, partly from the money they got by selling the old car, and the rest from their savings. \u201cThe air conditioning in the new car is really strong and that bodes well for our pets. There is also more space for passengers and luggage, helping us to go on long trips with our pets and extended family,\u201d says Singh. The new car, like the earlier Duster, is an automatic, saving them the trouble of shifting gears frequently in city traffic.",

    "content": "India captain Rohit Sharma had every reason to cheer after his side defeated Temba Bavuma's South Africa by 16 runs in the 2nd T20I to take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the series. After Harsha Bhogle jokingly asked Rohit what he was doing to help Suryakumar Yadav retain his purple patch form, the Indian captain made a hilarious remark, saying he was thinking of not playing the star batter until October 23.India vs South Africa, 2nd T20I: Report | HighlightsNotably, India will kick start its T20 World Cup against arch-rivals Pakistan on October 23 at the MCG.\"All of us came together and said this is what we want. It has given mixed results but we will continue that approach. In the recent past, the focus has been on each individual to come in and do the job, we've moved forward from there,\" Rohit Sharma said in the post-match presentation ceremony.Rohit also pointed out that India's biggest concern heading into the T20 World Cup was the death over bowling.\" (On death bowling) There is a concern to be honest, as we haven't bowled well. But that is the area where we will be challenged. We do it with the bat too. The expectations are high. It's not a concern but we have to pick ourselves. I'm thinking of not playing Surya till the 23rd to keep his form (laughs),\" Rohit added.Suryakumar produced a scintillating knock in the 2nd T20I against South Africa as he smashed the ball around the park to score an 18-ball half-century in Guwahati. Surya scored 61 off just 22 deliveries before being run out by South Africa skipper Temba Bavuma. Suryakumar also became the third-fastest Indian to reach 1000 runs in T20Is. The 32-year-old batter reached the four-figure mark in the shortest format of the game in his 31st innings.India scripted a bit of history on Sunday as they clinched their first-ever series victory over South Africa in T20I format at home. Rohit Sharma's men seem to have bounced back strong after the disappointment at the Asia Cup, beating reigning world champions Australia 2-1 and taking an unbeatable lead vs South Africa.",

The president argues the project will promote development in Mexico's poorer south while minimizing harm to the environment.Also Read | 36 OneWeb satellites arrive in India to be launched by Isro on GSLV Mk-III",

The motor, which uses Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) as fuel was tested at the Indian space agency's Propulsion Complex (IPRC), Mahendragiri.The motor is different from the traditionally used solid-solid or liquid-liquid combinations by Isro and it runs on Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) as fuel and liquid oxygen (LOX) as the oxidizer. Isro said that it is a hybrid motor which is a combination of solid fuel and liquid oxidizer.Developed by scientists at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), the motor was fired for 15 seconds during which it ensured sustained combustion. The motor is said to be advantageous due to its safe and green propulsion system.\"The test of a flight equivalent 30 kN hybrid motor demonstrated ignition and sustained combustion for the intended duration of 15 seconds. The motor performance was satisfactory,\" Isro said in a statement.The Indian space agency further added that the use of liquids facilitates throttling and the control over the flow rate of LOX enables the re-start capability.Also Read | 36 OneWeb satellites arrive in India to be launched by Isro on GSLV Mk-III\"While both HTPB and LOX are green, LOX is safer to handle. The hybrid motor tested today is scalable and stackable, potentially paving the way for a new propulsion system for the forthcoming launch vehicles,\" the statement read.The test comes just hours after a batch of 36 satellites part of a constellation by UK-based One Web arrived in India t be launched into Low Earth Orbit on a GSLV-MkIII. While Isro is yet to release details of the launch, the lift-off is expected to be conducted in October this year.The launch is part of an agreement signed between the United Kingdom-based firm and the NewSpace India Limited (NSIL).Also Read | Nasa to load fuel on Moon rocket today in key test to check leaks ahead of launch",

Nasa will, however, not go into the terminal count phase of the launch countdown.During the tanking operation, engineers will begin filling the mammoth fuel tanks of the SLS with Liquid Hydrogen as per the new regulations which ensure a much slower way to load the fuel.

Once the liquid hydrogen tank transitions from the slow fill phase to fast fill, teams will initiate, or \u201ckick-start,\u201d the flow of liquid hydrogen through the engines to begin conditioning or chilling them down, for launch.As the two tanks fill up the pre-pressurization test will bring the liquid hydrogen tank up to the pressure level it will experience just before launch while engineers calibrate the settings for conditioning the engines at a higher flow rate, as will be done during the terminal count.Nasa will load the fuel in both the core stage and upper stage tanks, and Orion and the SLS boosters will remain unpowered.The launch, if all goes well during the key test today, will be conducted on September 27.Also Read | This is how meteors crashing on Mars sound | Listen",

Similarly, for butter chicken fans, once you pick up the menu, you will get to know the calories per serving.In a major move aimed at regulating the calorie count of food products, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) made it mandatory for restaurant chains and online food aggregators to display the calorie count of food products on menu cards.As per the new regulations, restaurants having central licences or outlets at 10 or more locations will need to display the \"calorific value in kcal per serving and serving size\" of food items on menu cards, booklets or boards.ALSO READ | US eatery\u2019s bizarre South Indian menu has Twitter facepalming hard. Seen it yet?Speaking with India Today, FSSAI Compliance Officer, Inoshi Sharma, said, \"People need to know what they are eating. Health is wealth, just like one knows while buying clothes, cars, furniture, what you are buying, one needs to know about the ingredients being used in food items.\"\"We have started with big chains. Once we get that going, we will then move to apply the same rule to smaller joints too,\" Sharma said.\"Most of the establishments have complied with the norms, some have asked us for time, we have extended the time limit for them. Some, however, have not responded to us, so FSSAI has suspended their licences\", she added.The latest labelling and display regulations were notified by India\u2019s food regulator in November 2020. Restaurants were required to comply with these norms by January 1, 2022. The deadline was later extended to July 1. However, till date, there are some restaurants that have not complied with the regulations and have sought some more time.The task is cumbersome for big brands. If a brand has 150 recipes, then all of them have to be analysed, menus changed, additions made. Some chains have already started making changes and owners are appreciating the move.ALSO READ | Why there is a debate over service charge in restaurantsParamjeet Singh, owner of Artful Baker, believes this was the need of the hour. \"Just like we have the rate list, we will have a list with details of ingredients. This is common in the United States. I am glad that now this practice will be seen in India too,\" Singh said.\"People have become very health conscious nowadays and this description will abet healthy eating habits. A lot of youngsters have a habit of eating out daily. I hope once they read the description they will shift to healthier options,\u201d he added.The menu labelling phenomenon isn't new. From the United States of America to England, calorie and ingredient details are displayed on descriptions and menus.United States of AmericaThe US made menu labelling compulsory way back in 2018. From May 7, 2018, consumers had access to calorie and nutrition information in certain chain establishments covered under the rule.The menu labelling requirements apply to restaurants and similar retail food establishments that are part of a chain with 20 or more locations. In addition, they must be doing business under the same name and offering the same menu items for sale.In the US, the covered establishments disclose the number of calories contained in standard items on menus and menu boards. While for self-service foods and foods on display, the calorie count is listed in close proximity and clearly associated with the standard menu item.McDonald's Corp., the world's largest food chain, was one of the first chains to display a calorie count. All of the nearly 14,000 McDonald\u2019s in the United States started posting calorie information on the drive-thru and behind-the-counter menus in 2012.EnglandWhile the US was quick to apply the rule, England jumped on the bandwagon this year. From April 6, 2022, restaurants, cafes and takeaway stores with more than 250 staff started printing calories in their meals on their in-house menus, on their websites and on any delivery platforms.As a country where nearly two-thirds (63 per cent) of adults are obese or overweight, the rule was part of England's government to tackle obesity.",

The Associated Press reported that the National Guard has rescued more than 900 people as floodwaters continue to rush through towns in eastern and southern Puerto Rico with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain forecast for some areas. Multiple landslides also were reported.The blow from Fiona was made more devastating because Puerto Rico has yet to recover from Hurricane Maria, which killed nearly 3,000 people and destroyed the power grid in 2017. Five years later, more than 3,000 homes on the island are still covered by blue tarps.In Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States, residents were still facing strong winds, frequent lightning, and heavy rain on Monday.Fiona made landfall in Puerto Rico on Sunday afternoon, dumping up to 30 inches (76.2 cm) of rain in some areas, with at least two people killed. The storm comes five years after Puerto Rico was ravaged by Hurricane Maria, which triggered the worst power blackout in US history and killed 3,000.Also Read | This is how meteors crashing on Mars sound | Listen",

Researchers in Hong Kong have estimated that there are 20,000,000,000,000,000 or 20 quadrillion ants crawling all over Earth.\"The astounding ubiquity of ants has prompted many naturalists to contemplate their exact number on Earth, but systematic and empirically derived estimates are lacking,\" the team of researchers said.

Biomass refers to the total quantity or weight of organisms in a given area or volume. For comparison, the total biomass of wild birds and mammals combined is around 2 million tons.\"Our global map of ant abundance expands our understanding of the geography of ant diversity and provides a baseline for predicting ants\u2019 responses to worrying environmental changes that currently impact insect biomass,\" researchers said in the paper.The team from the School of Biological Sciences, The University of Hong Kong found that the abundances of ground-dwelling ants are strongly concentrated in tropical and subtropical regions but vary substantially across habitats.Also Read | New atlas of bird migration shows extraordinary journeys\"This study highlights the central role ants play in terrestrial ecosystems but also major ecological and geographic gaps in our current knowledge.

The species of ants have been on Earth for over 100 million years and have evolved through the millennia. Researchers have been able to 12,000 species of ants from across the world.According to Harvard Forest, ants are important because they are the source of aerating the soil, which allows water and oxygen to reach plant roots. They take seeds under the soil and consume nutritious elaiosomes, which help in the sprouting process for plants.

The full year CAD stood at 1.2% in the 2021/22 as compared to a surplus of 0.9% in 2020/21.\"Principal credit challenges include low per capita income, high general government debt, low debt affordability and limited government effectiveness,\" Moody's said.\"While risks stemming from a high debt burden and weak debt affordability remain, we expect that the economic environment will allow for a gradual narrowing in the general government fiscal deficit over the next few years, avoiding further deterioration in the sovereign credit profile,\" they wrote.The agency said it expects only a gradual consolidation of the fiscal deficits between 2022/23 and 2024/25 and thus sees debt stabilising at around 80% to GDP - still significantly higher than similar rated peers which have a median of around 55%.ALSO READ | Indian-origin Laxman Narasimhan is the new CEO of Starbucks",

It\u2019s the largest donation the fund has received since it started in 2019, and McKay\u2019s biggest personal gift. He joined the organization\u2019s board in August.Climate change is \u201cextremely alarming, extremely frightening, and quickly becoming the only thing I\u2019m thinking about on a daily basis, even as I\u2019m writing scripts and directing or producing,\u201d McKay said in a recent interview with The Associated Press.From the overthrowing of monarchies to labor movements and the Civil Rights Era, activism is an \u201cincredibly kinetic, powerful, transformative\u201d force that\u2019s created change throughout history, he said.Also Read | New atlas of bird migration shows extraordinary journeysThe Climate Emergency Fund has awarded $7 million to organizations supporting mostly volunteer climate activists around the globe.

But he sees both film and disruptive protest as actions that change culture, which can be a major step toward influencing policy. The film, he said, sparked an incredible reaction around the globe from ordinary viewers and scientists who have been fighting for climate action for decades.\u201cIt was really beautiful to see people who have been fighting this fight for much longer than me really feel seen,\u201d he said.Also Read | Cheetah 101: Meet the Usain Bolt of animalsMcKay, 54, started his career in comedy writing and became known for movies like \u201cAnchorman\u201d and \u201cStep Brothers.\u201d In recent years, his work has taken on a more political tone, though it\u2019s still in the realm of comedy \u2014 if dark.

It was the moment, he said, that he went from someone who was concerned about climate change to someone who saw it as a hair-on-fire situation.In the years since, the situation has only grown more dire, he said, pointing to the drying of the Colorado River, flooding in Pakistan and Europe\u2019s summer heatwave as evidence that action is urgent.\u201cI really do believe, without any hyperbole, scientifically speaking, this is the greatest challenge, story, threat, in human history,\u201d he said.Also Read | Why did Pakistan experience deadly floods?

    "content": "After a two-year Covid-induced hiatus, Gandhi Jayanti celebrations returned to China's sprawling Chaoyang Park here as it resonated with the recitation of his famous quotes by Chinese school children and his bhajans by members of the Indian diaspora.Gandhi Jayanti is celebrated every year at the picturesque Chaoyang Park in Beijing ever since the statue of Gandhi, sculpted by acclaimed sculptor Yuan Xikun, was installed in 2005 on the banks of a lake amid serene surroundings to enable his admirers to pay tributes to the Mahatma.Yuan besides being an acclaimed sculptor, who sculpted the statues of famous Chinese and world leaders, is also well connected with the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) and the long-time Curator of the famous Jin Tai Art Museum located in the Chaoyang park.ALSO READ | Gandhi Jayanti 2022: History, significance, importance, wishes and quotesYuan carved out the Gandhi statue with a unique posture of the Mahatma sitting with a book in his hand.The installation of Gandhi\u2019s statue for the first time officially in Beijing was regarded as politically significant as for decades the Mahatma, a contemporary of Mao Zedong who led China\u2019s national liberation movement, has remained an enigma in China as the two leaders professed contrasting political philosophies.While Mao remained a firm advocate of violent liberation movements with his famous dictum that power flows through the barrel of the gun, Gandhi\u2019s successful non-violent movement against the British, in contrast, caught the attention of the world.Since the installation of Gandhi's statue, on every October 2 a set of Chinese school children recite his famous sayings, highlighting non-violence, adherence to truth and the importance of conservation.The practice was disrupted due to the pandemic for the past two years.ALSO READ | Gandhi Jayanti: PM Modi, President Murmu pay tributes to Mahatma Gandhi, urges people to follow Bapu's stepsThis year, over a dozen school children recited Gandhi\u2019s sayings in both Chinese and English, drawing applause at a well-attended gathering at the Jin Tai Art Museum which included Indian Ambassador Pradeep Kumar Rawat and Yuan himself.Rawat, who played a role in the installation of the statue along with Yuan during his previous diplomatic stint in Beijing in 2005, said though born in India, Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s message resonated with the entire humanity.\u201cMahatma Gandhi\u2019s principle of non-violence was all-encompassing - human against human, human against animal and more importantly human against nature,\" Rawat said.Yuan in his address said Gandhi\u2019s sculpture has also \u201cbecome a symbol of friendship between the people of India and China\u201d.\"Why do I want to create Mahatma Gandhi? Gandhi's devotion, self-restraint and self- motivation have many refractive intersections with the ancient Chinese thinkers Confucius, Mencius and Lao Zhuang,\" Yuan said.\u201cThe excellent cultural heritage he left us is the glory of the whole of mankind. He was a man of nature and used in moderation, which is the sustainable development we advocate now,\" he said.ALSO READ | From the archives: Mahatma Gandhi, a lasting LegacyThis year\u2019s highlight, however, was the short play \"Being Mahatma\" which was enacted at the museum, highlighting the handling of some of the most tense situations by Gandhiji at the height of the independence movement.Scripted and directed by T S Vivekanand, a diplomat from the Indian Embassy here, \u2018Being Mahatma\u2019 is a play which attempts to understand why Gandhi was a great soul.\"It tries to make the case that Gandhi communicated with the masses differently than others,\" Vivekanand, a poet in Tamil and English, said.He recently released an anthology of poems called \u201cCogVerse\u201d.The cast included Joji Luka, a security officer of the Indian Embassy in Beijing who acted as Gandhi, besides Rajashree Behera, first secretary and Neeru Thakkar wife of Lekhan Thakkar, Counsellor, (Economic and Commerce) of the India mission.ALSO READ | Mahatma Gandhi, Bhagat Singh are the favourite national heroes of Indian students: Survey",

    "content": "Once unthinkable, mobile phones could go dark around Europe this winter if power cuts or energy rationing knocks out parts of the mobile networks across the region.Russia's decision to halt gas supplies via Europe's key supply route in the wake of the Ukraine conflict has increased the chances of power shortages. In France, the situation is made worse by several nuclear power plants shutting down for maintenance.Telecoms industry officials say they fear a severe winter will put Europe's telecoms infrastructure to the test, forcing companies and governments to try to mitigate the impact.Currently there are not enough back-up systems in many European countries to handle widespread power cuts, four telecoms executives said, raising the prospect of mobile phone outages.European Union countries, including France, Sweden and Germany, are trying to ensure communications can continue even if power cuts end up exhausting back-up batteries installed on the thousands of cellular antennas spread across their territory.Europe has nearly half a million telecom towers and most of them have battery backups that last around 30 minutes to run the mobile antennas.Also Read | Never seen so much lightning: Storm chaser on flight to eye of Hurricane Ian | WatchIn France, a plan put forward by electricity distributor Enedis, includes potential power cuts of up to two hours in a worst case scenario, two sources familiar with the matter said.The general black-outs would affect only parts of the country on a rotating basis. Essential services such as hospitals, police and government will not be impacted, the sources said.The French government, telecoms operators and Enedis, a unit of state-controlled utility EDF, have held talks on the issue over the summer, the French government and the sources said.The French Federation of Telecoms (FFT), a lobby group representing Orange (ORAN.PA), Bouygues Telecom and Altice's SFR, put the spotlight on Enedis for being unable to exempt antennas from the power cuts.Enedis declined to comment on the content of the talks held with the government on the matter.Enedis said in a statement to Reuters all regular customers were treated on an equal footing in the event of exceptional outages.It said it was able to isolate sections of the network to supply priority customers, such as hospitals, key industrial installations and the military, and that it was up to local authorities to add telecoms operators' infrastructure to the list of priority customers.Also Read | Congress nothing without Gandhis: Digvijaya Singh on eve of filing nomination for party chief post\"Maybe we'll improve our knowledge on the matter by this winter, but it's not easy to isolate a mobile antenna (from the rest of the network),\" said a French finance ministry official with knowledge of the talks.A French finance ministry spokesperson declined to comment on the talks with Enedis, the telecoms groups and the government.Telcos in Sweden and Germany have also raised concerns over potential electricity shortages with their governments, several sources familiar with the matter said.Swedish telecom regulator PTS is working with telecom operators and other government agencies to find solutions, it said. That includes talks about what will happen if electricity is rationed.PTS is financing the purchase of transportable fuel stations and mobile base stations that connect to mobile phones to handle longer power outages, a PTS spokesperson said.The Italian telecoms lobby told Reuters it wants the mobile network to be excluded from any power cut or energy-saving stoppage and will raise this with Italy's new government.The power outages increase the probability of electronic components failing if subjected to abrupt interruptions, telecoms lobby chief Massimo Sarmi said in an interview.Also Read | Asteroid that killed dinosaurs on Earth also attacked MoonTelecom gear makers Nokia and Ericsson are working with mobile operators to mitigate the impact of a power shortage, three sources familiar with the matter said.Both companies declined to comment.The European telecom operators must review their networks to reduce extra power usage and modernise their equipment by using more power efficient radio designs, the four telecom executives said.To save power, telecom companies are using software to optimise traffic flow, make towers \"sleep\" when not in use and switch off different spectrum bands, the sources familiar with the matter said.The telecom operators are also working with national governments to check if plans are in place to maintain critical services.In Germany, Deutsche Telekom has 33,000 mobile radio sites (towers) and its mobile emergency power systems can only support a small number of them at the same time, a company spokesperson said.Deutsche Telekom will use mobile emergency power systems which mainly rely on diesel in the event of prolonged power failures, it said.France has about 62,000 mobile towers, and the industry will not be able to equip all antennas with new batteries, the FFT's president Liza Bellulo said.Accustomed to uninterrupted power supply for decades, European countries usually do not have generators backing up power for longer durations.\"We are a bit spoiled maybe in large parts of Europe where electricity is pretty stable and good,\" a telecom industry executive said. \"The investments in the energy storage area have maybe been less than in some other countries.\"Also Read | Nord Stream pipeline Leak: What has unfolded so far",

The car belonged to Peter Paul David and the other three - Sajjad Shah, Ziaullah and Ayesha - were facilitators.Saeed, chief of the banned Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD) has been serving a jail sentence at the Kot Lakhpat Jail, Lahore for his conviction in terror financing cases. There were unconfirmed reports that Saeed was present at his house when the blast took place.The 71-year-old radical cleric and a UN-designated terrorist, whom the US has placed a USD 10 million bounty on, has been convicted of 36 years imprisonment in five terror financing cases.

He was listed under the UN Security Council Resolution 1267 in December 2008.The global terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is instrumental in pushing Pakistan to take measures against terrorists roaming freely in the country and using its territory to carry out attacks in India.",

Images released by Planet Labs of the affected parts within Baltic Sea provide further credibility to the situation.READ | How Nord Stream pipeline leak is a threat to climateSwedish Maritime Administration: Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline leak in Swedish and Danish waters https://t.co/4PjCRkKiVb via @AJABreaking pic.twitter.com/vtic90vpxpBoth of the gas pipelines are owned by the Russian state-owned gas agency, Gazprom. Out of the two, the Nord Stream 1 pipeline constitutes two branches, both parallel to one another. The pipeline has ceased its operations since late August when Russia claimed it needed maintenance. Its total length is said to be around 745 miles, going from St Petersburg to north-eastern Germany.As per the Swedish state broadcaster SVT, the first explosion was recorded at 2.03am on Monday and the second at 7.04pm on the same day. Warnings about the gas leaks came from the maritime authority at 1.52pm and 8.41pm on Monday respectively, after ships detected bubbles on the surface. SVT also claims to have obtained the coordinates of the measured explosions, and they were in the same area where the gas leaks were registered.ALSO READ | Explained: Nord Stream gas pipelines leak and a possible 'sabotage'Dr Paul Balcombe, honorary lecturer at the Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London, commented on the situation on Wednesday that \"We don\u2019t know exactly how much gas was in the pipes, but there are estimates of 150 300 million cubic metres. There are three pipes that are leaking two pipes of Nord Stream 1, and one of Nord Stream 2. It is unlikely that they will release all their contents, but if just one did it would be about twice as much (~200,000 tonnes) as the 2015 Aliso Canyon leak in the US (90,000 tonnes) which was the worst leak found in the US. It would have a very large environmental and climate impact indeed, even if it released a fraction of this.\"The European Union, along with NATO and the North Atlantic Council (NAC) has called the leaks to be \u201creckless sabotage\u201d. In its statement on Thursday, the NAC further warned that any deliberate attack against allies\u2019 critical infrastructure would be met with a united and determined response.ALSO READ | Fourth leak found on Nord Stream pipelines, Swedish coast guard saysThe Swedish Maritime Administration established prohibition zones around the leaks as a form of safety measure by sending out navigation warnings on Navtex and VHF that ships should stay away from the area. Such warnings were also issued for aircraft with a safety altitude of 1,000 meters.German, Danish and Swedish vessels are constantly monitoring the area around the two pipelines since the explosions occurred in order to investigate the possible cause of the leaks.

Nick Underwood has been hunting hurricanes and supporting science missions aboard the US\u2019 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s aircraft for the last six years.When I say this was the roughest flight of my career so far, I mean it. I have never seen the bunks come out like that. There was coffee everywhere. I have never felt such lateral motion.Aboard Kermit (#NOAA42) this morning into Hurricane #Ian. Please stay safe out there. https://t.co/DQwqBwAE6v pic.twitter.com/gvV7WUJ6aS\u201cI have flown storms for the last six years. This flight to Hurricane Ian on Kermit was the worst I\u2019ve ever been on. I\u2019ve never seen so much lightning in an eye. This was the eye. You can see the curvature.

The light is from LIGHTNING,\u201d Underwood, who flew with a crew into Hurricane Ian, posted on Twitter.Also Read | Millions in Florida urged to evacuate as Hurricane Ian nears\u201cAbsolutely wild.

I\u2019m glad we only did one pass,\u201d the next tweet on the thread read.Underwood also posted a short video from inside the flight, which had \u201ccoffee everywhere\u201d.The extremely turbulent two minutes and 20 seconds on the flight is enough to fathom the impact of the hurricane that plowed over the US.The flight crew can be seen in the video being pushed and shoved around violently by the turbulence in their seats. Some even laughed through the storm, as terrific lightning flashed outside the windows.Equipment and other items on the craft, including the bunks, could be heard getting knocked over. At the end, a voice is heard: \u201cWe're alright, we're alright.\u201d At the end, Underwood also posted photos of the \u201caftermath of the galley\u201d. Coffee spilled all over the counter, a slipper right next to a microwave oven, water bottle packs on the floor along with a towel, a bag and a mattress.Hurricane Ian, one of the most powerful storms recorded in the US, made landfall on the Florida coast on Wednesday, unleashing torrential rains and howling winds. Visuals from the hurricane showed reporters getting swept away and sharks swimming in the streets.Before making landfall in Florida, the hurricane tore through Cuba, killing two and bringing down the country\u2019s electrical grid, leaving 11 million with no electricity. The US border authorities reported 20 Cuban migrants missing after their boat sank off the Florida coast as the hurricane approached.Also Read | Reporter flies away, sharks on streets: Hurricane Ian lashes Florida | Video",

    "content": "Despite chatter over the selection and injury issues for T20 World Cup, India put their head down and came up with a comprehensive performance in the 2nd of a 3-match T20I series against South Africa in Guwahati on Sunday, October 2. After posting a record-setting 237 for 3 on the board, India restricted South Africa to 221 to take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the series.David Miller's stunning 106 not out in 47 balls in a 174-run stand with Quinton de Kock was not enough as South Africa fell short of the total by 16 runs on an evening in which more than 450 runs were scored.India scripted a bit of history on Sunday as they clinched their first-ever series victory over South Africa in T20I format at home. Rohit Sharma's men seem to have bounced back strong after the disappointment at the Asia Cup, beating reigning world champions Australia 2-1 and taking an unbeatable lead vs South Africa.Appreciation all around for David Miller.But it's #TeamIndia who win the second #INDvSA T20I to take an unassailable lead in the series.Scorecard https://t.co/58z7VHliro pic.twitter.com/ShKkaF0inWIndia vs South Africa, 2nd T20I HighlightsThe build-up to the 2nd T20I in Guwahati was dominated by the injury news to Jasprit Bumrah and speculation about his availability for the T20 World Cup. Bumrah was ruled out of the ongoing T20I series due to a back injury but India made sure the narrative was about their batting might with a stupendous display of big-hitting against a full-strength South Africa bowling attack.India post 237 on the board in their quota of 20 overs, their 4th-highest T20I total and their highest against the Proteas. india's highest-ranked T20I batter Suryakumar Yadav showcased once again why he is arguably the best batter in the shortest format going around, smashing 61 off just 22 balls.Suryakumar hit 5 sixes and.5 boundaries, flaunting his 360 degree hitting ability. The Mumbai Indians batter also completed 1000 runs in T20I cricket and celebrated his milestone in style with a match-winning show. It was an effortless show once again from the star batter.Suryakumar was run-out for 61 in the 19th over but the damage was done as he had stitched a 102-run partnership for the 3rd wicket with Virat Kohli.The former India captain also achieved a major milestone as he completed 11,000 T20 runs. Kohli remained unbeaten on 49 off just 28 balls, proving once again that he has more than one gear, giving good company to Suryakumar.Kohli sent the packed house in Guwahati into a frenzy, playing some of his trademark shots as he showcased once again that he is close to hitting peak form ahead of the T20 World Cup.However, the biggest plus for India on Sunday was KL Rahul as the vice-captain proved critics over his strike rate wrong. Rahul has been under the radar for his inability to get going from the word go ever since he returned from injury at the Asia Cup.However, on Sunday, Rahul was at his brutal best, smashing 57 off 28 balls, hitting 5 boundaries and 4 sixes. Rahul took the attack to the South Africa new-ball bowlers even as his partner, Rohit was taking his time to get going.Rahul had scored a patient 51 in the first T20I in Thiruvananthapuram where batting was not as easy as it was on Sunday. Questions were asked of his strike rate but it was a crucial knock on a tricky pitch.However, on Sunday, Rahul showcased intent from the very first delivery he was in the middle, hitting some delightful big ones.",

Therefore, let\u2019s say: the locomotive has already started and it\u2019s unlikely to be stopped.\"To annex the territories, which represent about 15% of Ukraine, some sort of treaty will need to be struck and ratified by the Russian parliament, which is controlled by Putin allies. The areas will then be seen as part of Russia and its nuclear umbrella will extend to them.Putin has warned he would use nuclear weapons to protect Russian territory from attack.Residents who escaped to Ukrainian-held areas in recent days have told of people being forced to mark ballots in the street by roving officials at gunpoint. Footage filmed during the exercise showed Russian-installed officials taking ballot boxes from house to house with armed men in tow.\"They can announce anything they want. Nobody voted in the referendum except a few people who switched sides. They went from house to house but nobody came out,\" said Lyubomir Boyko, 43, from Golo Pristan, a village in Russian-occupied Kherson province.Russia says voting was voluntary, in line with international law, and that turnout was high. The referendums and notion of annexations has been rejected globally, as was Russia's 2014 takeover of Crimea from Ukraine.ALSO READ | Ukraine and Russia: What you need to know right nowUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy sought to rally international support against annexation in a series of calls with foreign leaders, including those of Britain, Canada, Germany and Turkey.\"Thank you all for your clear and unequivocal support. Thank you all for understanding our position,\" Zelenskiy said in a late-night video address.The United States has unveiled a $1.1 billion weapons package for Ukraine that includes 18 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers, accompanying munitions, various types of counter drone systems and radar systems. The announcement brings the U.S. security aid to $16.2 billion.The United States has also said it would also impose new sanctions on Russia for the referendums and the European Union's executive proposed more sanctions, but the bloc's 27 member countries will need to overcome their own differences to implement them.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would need to keep fighting until it had taken control of all of Donetsk.

The defendants' exact offence under the official secrets act remains unclear, though a source previously said Turnell's offence \"relates to an allegation that he had government documents\".An analyst for the International Crisis Group think tank, Richard Horsey, called the proceedings \"a show trial\".\"For Sean the hope now must be that - having already been in detention for almost 20 months - he will be released soon from this terrible ordeal and reunited with his family,\" he said.ALSO READ | Myanmar military open to negotiations with Suu Kyi after her trial: Junta chief",

    "content": "After observing Jupiter and revealing a unique set of rings going around it, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has trained its lenses towards Mars. The world\u2019s most powerful observatory has captured its first images and spectra of Mars, which could help better understand churnings happening on the Red Planet.The telescope, which is equipped to take science back in time and observe the changes and evolution that have shaped planetary objects over millennia, can help in revealing new insights into the planet's dust storms, weather patterns, seasonal changes, and the processes that occur at different times of Martian day.The telescope joins orbiters and rovers in unraveling the secrets of Mars as humans look to set up colonies on the planet in the near future.Also Read | Hubble captures spiral arms of a galaxy filled with young sunsThe telescope in its first image captured the Red Planet using its Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), which shows a region of the planet\u2019s eastern hemisphere at two different wavelengths. Nasa released the image with a surface reference map and the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) on the left, with the two Webb NIRCam instrument fields of view overlaid.The image captured by the NIRCam reveals surface details similar to those apparent in visible-light images. The image shows the rings of the Huygens Crater, the dark volcanic rock of Syrtis Major, and the brightening in the Hellas Basin are all apparent in this image.Also Read | China unveils Mars mission results, rover travels 1.9 kms on Red PlanetMeanwhile, the NIRCam image captured at a longer wavelength shows off the light given off by the planet as it loses heat. \"The brightest region on the planet is where the Sun is nearly overhead, because it is generally warmest. The brightness decreases towards the polar regions, which receive less sunlight, and less light is emitted from the cooler northern hemisphere, which is experiencing winter at this time of year,\" Nasa said in a release with the image.Located nearly 1,50,000 kilometers away from Earth, the James Webb telescope is equipped to see light coming from the edge of time. However, Mars is the closest planet to the spacecraft, which adds to new challenges in observing it. The location provides a view of Mars\u2019 observable disk, which is the portion of the sunlit side that is facing the telescope.Since Mars is closest to the observatory, the Red Planet is one of the brightest objects in the night sky in terms of both visible light (which human eyes can see) and infrared light. This adds to the difficulty since the observatory was built to detect the extremely faint light of the most distant galaxies in the universe.To see Mars, the Webb team had to adjust for Mars\u2019 extreme brightness by using very short exposures, measuring only some of the light that hit the detectors, and applying special data analysis techniques.Also Read | Jupiter to be closest to Earth in 70 years on this date",

The firm, Sinogene Biotechnology, released a video of Maya, the world's first cloned wild arctic wolf, 100 days after her birth in a Beijing lab.Maya, the first ever cloned wild arctic wolf, is 100 days old and is in good health, the Global Times reported. Maya's donor cell came from the skin sample of a wild female arctic wolf. Its oocyte was from a female dog and its surrogate mother was a beagle, the report said.The cloning of the arctic wolf was accomplished by constructing over 130 new embryos from enucleated oocytes of a female dog and somatic cells of a wild female arctic wolf. This was followed by the transfer of over 80 embryos to the uteri of seven beagles, of which one was born as a healthy wolf.The selection of a dog as the wolf's surrogate was made because dogs share genetic ancestry with ancient wolves and it is more likely to succeed through cloning technology, experts told the Global Times.The cloned wolf Maya now lives with her surrogate beagle in a lab and later she will be delivered to the Harbin Polarland, Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province and displayed to the public, the report said.According to experts, cloning technology will help in breeding more rare and endangered animals.",

    "content": "A weakened but still formidable Hurricane Ian chugged across Florida toward the Atlantic seaboard on Thursday after thrashing the state's Gulf Coast with fierce winds, torrential downpours and raging surf that flooded oceanside communities.Ian blasted ashore with catastrophic force on Wednesday afternoon as a Category 4 hurricane, packing maximum sustained winds of 150 miles per hour (241 kph), and quickly plunged the region's flat, low-lying landscape into a scene of devastation.Ian's winds, making it one of the most intense storms to strike the U.S. mainland in recent years, diminished significantly after nightfall. Within eight hours of its arrival, Ian was downgraded to Category 1 on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, with top sustained winds of 90 mph (150 kmh), the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported.ALSO READ | Hurricane Ian swamps southwest Florida, trapping people in homesHowever, the sprawling, slow-moving hurricane continued to unleash drenching rains as it crept farther inland, threatening to trigger extensive additional flooding.\"This storm is doing a number on the state of Florida,\" said Governor Ron DeSantis, who asked U.S. President Joe Biden to approve a major federal disaster declaration providing a wide range of U.S. emergency aid to the entire state.There were no official reports of storm-related fatalities or serious injuries. An unspecified number of people were known to be stranded and in need of help in \"high-risk\" areas after choosing to ride out the storm at home rather than heed evacuation orders, but they were beyond the immediate reach of rescue crews, DeSantis said.Separately, U.S. border authorities said 20 Cuban migrants were missing after their boat sank off the Florida coast as Ian neared the coast on Wednesday.At 10 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, strong gusts and horizontal rains were still lashing Venice, Florida, a city of about 25,000 residents some 32 miles northwest of where Ian first came ashore at the barrier island of Cayo Costa seven hours earlier.Larger structures remained mostly intact, but small, residential areas off of Highway 41, a major artery through the area, were left in a shambles.Downed trees and power lines covered roadways to the point that the asphalt was not visible, roofs were ripped off of some homes, and water was pouring into neighborhoods from seemingly all directions.ALSO READ | Hurricane Ian looks furious from space as Category-3 storm hits CubaA large open lot in front of a Winn Dixie grocery store became a lake, with white-capping waters reaching the trunks of some the cars parked there. Power was out in larger swaths of the area, with communications nearly impossible in many spots.Ian was forecast to weaken further as it crossed the Florida peninsula on a northeasterly track, and was expected to reach the Atlantic Coast on Thursday afternoon, possibly as a tropical storm, according to the NHC.But Ian remained a potent force. Up to 30 inches (76 cm) of rain was forecast to fall on parts of central Florida, the NHC said. By late Wednesday night, the storm had knocked out power to at least 2 million homes and businesses statewide, utilities reported.Hours before, Florida's idyllic southwestern shoreline, dotted with sandy beaches, coastal towns and mobile home parks, was rapidly transformed into a disaster zone inundated by seawater.Video images of the storm's fury on local TV and social media showed floodwater nearly reaching rooftops in some communities, sweeping away cars and the ruins of homes as palm trees were bent almost in half.Having pummeled Cuba on Tuesday, leaving the island nation without power for hours, Ian swept into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and reached its peak wind speeds of 155 mph, just shy of a Category 5 designation, shortly before landfall in Florida on Wednesday.DeSantis said Ian had generated life-threatening storm surges - waves of wind-driven seawater rushing in along the coast - of up to 12 feet (3.7 meters) in some places. Forecasters also warned of intense thunderstorms and possible tornadoes.ALSO READ | Storm we will talk about for many years: Hurricane Ian hits Florida's Gulf Coast\"This is a storm that we will talk about for many years to come, an historic event,\" said Ken Graham, director of the National Weather Service.By comparison, Hurricane Michael came ashore in Florida's panhandle in 2018 with steady winds of 155 mph, while Ida last year packed sustained winds of 150 mph when it landed in Louisiana.Even as Ian lashed the coast before it finally swept ashore, authorities warned residents it was too late for anyone who had yet to evacuate to safely do so. Earlier this week, more than 2.5 million residents had been told to evacuate.Many mobile home residents took refuge in local schools and other facilities converted to emergency shelters. The area's numerous assisted-living facilities were mostly evacuated, too.ALSO READ | Hurricane Ian strikes Cuba, Florida braces for category 4 damage",

The China National Space Administration (CNSA) is planning to begin tourism flights to space by 2025 and is expected to charge passengers $287,200 to $430,800, around 2-3 million yuan per seat.CGTN reported that the country is expected to focus on brief suborbital flights that would take passengers into space on brief joyrides and return them home. Yang Yiqiang, a senior rocket scientist, and founder of Beijing-based rocket company CAS Space told CGTN that there are three modes of space travel that are being explored.The space tourism flights could be the same as that of the Jeff Bezos-led Blue Origin, which takes paying customers above the surface of Earth to an altitude of 100 kilometers, touching the Karmen line and returning.

    "content": "A bay-breasted warbler weighs about the same as four pennies, but twice a year makes an extraordinary journey. The tiny songbird flies nearly 4,000 miles (6,437 kilometers) between Canada\u2019s spruce forests and its wintering grounds in northern South America.\u201cMigratory birds are these little globetrotters,\u201d said Jill Deppe, the senior director of the migratory bird initiative at the National Audubon Society.A new online atlas of bird migration, published on Thursday, draws from an unprecedented number of scientific and community data sources to illustrate the routes of about 450 bird species in the Americas, including the warblers.The Bird Migration Explorer mapping tool, available free to the public, is an ongoing collaboration between 11 groups that collect and analyze data on bird movements, including the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center, the U.S. Geological Survey, Georgetown University, Colorado State University, and the National Audubon Society.For the first time, the site will bring together online data from hundreds of scientific studies that use GPS tags to track bird movements, as well as more than 100 years of bird-banding data collected by USGS, community science observations entered into Cornell\u2019s eBird platform, genomic analysis of feathers to pinpoint bird origins, and other data.Also Read | Never seen before Sun Halo appears in skies over Mars\u201cThe past twenty years have seen a true renaissance in different technologies to track bird migrations around the world at scales that haven\u2019t been possible before,\u201d said Peter Marra, a bird migration expert at Georgetown University who collaborated on the project.The site allows a user to enter a species \u2014 for instance, osprey \u2014 and watch movements over the course of a year. For example, data from 378 tracked ospreys show up as yellow dots that move between coastal North America and South America as a calendar bar scrolls through the months of the year.Or users can enter the city where they live and click elsewhere on the map for a partial list of birds that migrate between the two locations. For example, ospreys, bobolinks and at least 12 other species migrate between Washington, D.C. and Fonte Boa, Brazil.As new tracking data becomes available, the site will continue to expand. Melanie Smith, program director for the site, said the next phase of expansion will add more data about seabirds.Also Read | Cheetah 101: Meet the Usain Bolt of animalsWashington, D.C. resident Michael Herrera started birdwatching about four months ago and was quickly hooked. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like this hidden world that\u2019s right in front of your eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you start paying attention, all these details that were like background noise suddenly have meaning.\u201dHerrera said he\u2019s eager to learn more about the migratory routes of waterbirds in the mid-Atlantic region, such as great blue herons and great egrets.Georgetown\u2019s Marra hopes that engaging the public will help spotlight some of the conservation challenges facing birds, including loss of habitat and climate change.In the past 50 years, the population of birds in the U.S. and Canada has dropped nearly 30%, with migratory species facing some of the steepest declines.Also Read | Australian fish fossils get to the heart of vertebrate evolution",

    "content": "For the 157-year-old multi-billion dollar Shapoorji Pallonji Group, the death of its youngest scion Cyrus Mistry in a tragic road accident, is a double-loss as his untimely passing away comes on the heels of the group patriarch's demise late June.The nearly USD 30-billion diversified group, which owns 18.6 per cent in the USD 130-billion Tata Group, was founded by the late senior Pallonji Mistry (great grandfather of Cyrus) in 1865 as Littlewood Pallonji & Co.Cyrus' father Pallonji Mistry, who died on June 28, 2022, at the age of 93, is dubbed as 'the Phantom of Bombay House'. According to the Bloomberg billionaires index, the SP Group has a networth of about USD 30 billion in 2022.The Mistry's epic showdown after Cyrus Mistry was thrown out of the group as the chairman in a board coup in October 2016, with the Tata Group sparked the biggest corporate feud in the history of India Inc.ALSO READ | Cyrus Mistry, former Tata Group chairman, dies in road accident in MaharashtraUnder Cyrus' watch, the Tata Group (top-20 listed group companies) grew by CAGR of 12.5 per cent, while their debt has increased at a slower pace of 9.98 per cent from Rs 1.89 lakh crore to Rs 2.29 lakh crore.But during this period, the net profit zoomed at a CAGR of 42.3 per cent, indicating much more efficient operations under his tenure and he left the group with an overall turnover of over USD 100 billion which also nearly doubled under his watch.The SP Group's interest spans from engineering & construction under its flagship Afcons, real estate, consumer goods and solar power, from the last two it had exited recently as part of deleveraging. The group employs more than 50,000 people in more than 50 countries today.Cyrus, 54, who died on the spot earlier in the day when his car lost control on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad highway, was the youngest son of Pallonji Mistry and left behind his wife Rohiqua and two sons, Firoz and Zahan.Cyrus since his appointment as the chairman of the Tata Group in December 2012 has not been into the operations of the family business having entrusted it to his elder brother Shapoor Mistry.Since late 2019, the group underwent more management changes with Shapoor's son Pallon, 26, being inducted on the board of the group holding company, while daughter Tanya handling the group's corporate social responsibility activities.The new-gen has been mandated to help the group companies with digitalisation and have better communication with its shareholders. Pallon is now part of the apex panel that takes long term, strategic and impactful decisions.Shapoorji Pallonji & Co has been known for its engineering prowess and is the oldest domestic construction engineering and construction company in the country, under its flagship Afcons.The company's first project was the construction of pavement on the Girgaum Chowpatty in south Mumbai, followed by the construction of a reservoir on Malabar Hill which has been supplying water to the megapolis since then.The SP group's engineering empire has constructed opulent hotels, stadia, palaces, and factories across Asia.ALSO READ | Cyrus Mistry's death brings focus back to laws on seatbelts in IndiaSome of the iconic buildings that the group built over the decades include the Reserve Bank of India headquarters, the BSE Towers, the Oberoi hotel in Mumbai, and the blue-and-gold Al Alam palace for the Sultan of Oman, apart from the Statue of Belief--of lord Shiva in Nathdwara in Rajasthan, is amongst the largest statue of Shiva in the world and the fourth-largest statue in the world), the Jumeirah Lake Towers in Dubai and Ebene Cyber City in Mauritius.Some of its latest engineering landmarks are the Chenab Railway Bridge, Atal Tunnel, Dhaka-Chittagong railway corridor, the first Kolkata metro.The company also built the Brabourne stadium in Mumbai, the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in New Delhi and the Mumbai Central Railway station in just 21 months for Rs 1.6 crore. In 2010, it built the country's tallest building of the time, The Imperial, a residential tower in Mumbai.The SP group had exited from consumer durbales business Eureka Forbes, known for its vacuum cleaners and water purifiers, after selling its remaining 8.7 percent stake to Lunolux, a firm backed by private equity firm Advent International in September 2021 for Rs 4,400 crore. Similarly, it has also sold its majority stake in Sterling & Wilson Solar Power to a Reliance Industries entity in October 2021.Since 2012, when the late Pallonji Mistry announced retirement, the group has been under the control of his eldest son and Cyrus's elder brother Shapoor Pallonji Mistry.The reorganisation was also due to the fact that in December 2012, Cyrus was appointed chairman of Tata Sons following which he withdrew completely from the family business \u201cto ensure that there is no conflict of interest with the Tata group, including banning his family companies from entering into any business with any Tata entities unless through open competitive budding\u201d.From early 2003, the Mistry family gave up their Indian citizenship and became Irish nationals. This was also because Cyrus' mother Patsy Perin Dubash is from Dublin and the change of their citizenship was on \u201cthe basis of his marriage to an Irish national.'The family's interest in Ireland is compounded by their love of horses and they also own a 200 acre stud farm in Pune.",

According to GDP figures from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the UK\u2019s economy dropped behind India in its first quarter. A decade ago, India ranked 11th among the largest economies, while the UK was 5th.The change in the rankings comes at a time when the UK is soon to get its new Prime Minister. The slip in the UK\u2019s ranking is reportedly due to the soaring cost of living in the country.Last month, the country witnessed double-digit consumer price inflation (10.1%) for the first time since 1982. The drop in rank sets off to further intensify the challenges for the successor of former Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Reportedly, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is likely to beat former Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak in the Prime Ministerial race.The new prime minister will have to address the most pressing situation in the UK, which faces rising risks of a recession. According to the Bank of England, the risks of a recession may last up until 2024.On the other hand, the Indian economy is expected to grow by more than 7% this year. Indian stocks sharply rebounded to secure the second spot in Morgan Stanley Capital International\u2019s (MSCI) emerging markets index, second only to China.The IMF's own forecasts suggest that India could potentially surpass the UK in dollar terms on an annual basis in 2022. This would put India behind just the US, China, Japan and Germany.On an adjusted basis and using the dollar exchange rate on the last day of the relevant quarter, the size of the Indian economy in \"nominal\" cash terms in the quarter through March was $854.7 billion. On the same basis, the UK was $816 billion, reported Bloomberg.The UK\u2019s GDP reportedly grew by 1% in cash terms in its second quarter, which dwindled further to 0.1% after adjusting the inflation.

Rohit Sharma's men seem to have bounced back strong after the disappointment at the Asia Cup, beating reigning world champions Australia 2-1 and taking an unbeatable lead vs South Africa.Appreciation all around for David Miller.But it's #TeamIndia who win the second #INDvSA T20I to take an unassailable lead in the series.Scorecard https://t.co/58z7VHliro pic.twitter.com/ShKkaF0inWIndia vs South Africa, 2nd T20I HighlightsThe build-up to the 2nd T20I in Guwahati was dominated by the injury news to Jasprit Bumrah and speculation about his availability for the T20 World Cup. Bumrah was ruled out of the ongoing T20I series due to a back injury but India made sure the narrative was about their batting might with a stupendous display of big-hitting against a full-strength South Africa bowling attack.India post 237 on the board in their quota of 20 overs, their 4th-highest T20I total and their highest against the Proteas. india's highest-ranked T20I batter Suryakumar Yadav showcased once again why he is arguably the best batter in the shortest format going around, smashing 61 off just 22 balls.Suryakumar hit 5 sixes and.5 boundaries, flaunting his 360 degree hitting ability. The Mumbai Indians batter also completed 1000 runs in T20I cricket and celebrated his milestone in style with a match-winning show. It was an effortless show once again from the star batter.Suryakumar was run-out for 61 in the 19th over but the damage was done as he had stitched a 102-run partnership for the 3rd wicket with Virat Kohli.The former India captain also achieved a major milestone as he completed 11,000 T20 runs. Kohli remained unbeaten on 49 off just 28 balls, proving once again that he has more than one gear, giving good company to Suryakumar.Kohli sent the packed house in Guwahati into a frenzy, playing some of his trademark shots as he showcased once again that he is close to hitting peak form ahead of the T20 World Cup.However, the biggest plus for India on Sunday was KL Rahul as the vice-captain proved critics over his strike rate wrong. Rahul has been under the radar for his inability to get going from the word go ever since he returned from injury at the Asia Cup.However, on Sunday, Rahul was at his brutal best, smashing 57 off 28 balls, hitting 5 boundaries and 4 sixes. Rahul took the attack to the South Africa new-ball bowlers even as his partner, Rohit was taking his time to get going.Rahul had scored a patient 51 in the first T20I in Thiruvananthapuram where batting was not as easy as it was on Sunday. Questions were asked of his strike rate but it was a crucial knock on a tricky pitch.However, on Sunday, Rahul showcased intent from the very first delivery he was in the middle, hitting some delightful big ones.",

    "content": "India and the United States, the world\u2019s two largest democracies, do not share a narrow relationship only devoted to bilateral gains, but one that impacts the rest of the world, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has said.He said both countries have recognised that this is a relationship of great capability and potential and there is still a lot of room for it to grow.\u201cIf you look at the India-US relationship, it's not a narrow relationship only devoted to each other's gains. Our relationship today impacts the rest of the world, definitely does the Indo-Pacific,\u201d Jaishankar told a group of Indian reporters on Wednesday as he concluded his four-day official trip to the American capital.Starting with an interaction with the diaspora on Sunday, Jaishankar over the next four days met his American counterpart, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan: and five lawmakers including Senator Mark Warner and Congressman Ami Bera.ALSO READ | All lies, can't trust our government: Man flees to Georgia after Putin's mobilisation orderJaishankar also had meetings with the American business community. He described his visit as a very comfortable one during which he had good conversations.\u201cThere are a lot of countries who look to us individually or bilaterally, some part of the betterment, which they hope for, the solutions which the world is searching for, in many respects,\u201d he said.\u201cBilateral, a very solid, positive, productive bilateral conversation, but framed in the context of larger global challenges. There's a high degree of convergence on how we look at those challenges, we may articulate it a little bit differently,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s natural our position's will not be identical, our priorities may sometimes be a little bit different. But again, the good part of the relationship is today, that we understand that we have to make space for each other, and that we can work with each other, even if we do not entirely agree on every aspect of every issue,\u201d said the minister.Jaishankar said overall the India-US ties are in a good place.\u201cIf you look, our trades been doing well, our political exchanges have been very solid. There might be some process issues on visas, but in terms of actual movement of people, it's on a longer timeframe again, being quite positive,\u201d he said, adding that the student numbers are also strong.\u201cSo, there's really a lot that we can look at and credit ourselves with,\u201d he said.\u201cBut having said that both sides have recognised this is a relationship of great capability and potential. There's still a lot of room for it to grow. There are new avenues that we could look at. And part of the reason for the meeting with the ambassador organised with the National Science Foundation was really, how do we look at science and technology and research and collaboration and critical and emerging technologies, and really create some big broad avenues for further collaboration?\u201d he said.ALSO READ | Mahsa Amini's death tragic but chaos unacceptable: Iran president amid raging protestsIndia has offered its help to the United States to address the issue of massive American visa backlogs, he said and hoped that things would improve soon.Jaishankar raised the issue of backlog in American visa appointments during his meeting with the Secretary of State Blinken on Tuesday.\u201cTo Secretary Blinken, I suggested that if there was something we could do from the Indian government, to help the US come and deal with this issue in a better way, we would be very open to doing it. I think there might be some issues which he might send our way,\u201d Jaishankar said.\u201cI feel this is an issue where, obviously it's mainly for the US to do, but we will be supportive and collaborative because it is an issue. We have today, and I and I heard this on a very regular basis in India,\u201d he said.There are families who are not able to meet, there are people who can't keep their business appointments. There are students who are waiting for a long time. So, it's a genuinely serious problem of some magnitude, Jaishankar said.\u201cBut I'm very confident that with the sincerity that Secretary Blinken showed and the seriousness with which I hope they would address this and, with any support that we can provide, we hope that things will improve,\u201d he said.During the joint news conference with him a day earlier, Blinken explained the compulsions and the constraints of the US.ALSO READ | State govt denies permission for RSS rallies across Tamil Nadu on Gandhi Jayanti\u201cI think he was very sincere about trying to rectify the situation,\u201d Jaishankar said.Jaishankar said he saw a great deal of enthusiasm on the American side.The world economy was already under a lot of stress, because of the COVID-19 and the Ukraine conflict, and its repercussions have added to that, he said.\u201cToday, for a lot of countries, including us, much higher energy costs, are a source of obvious anxiety. We can see food inflation. Some countries even face availability challenges. That's another big worry. There are justified concerns about fertilisers, access to fertilizers and trade in fertilizers. Remember, today's fertiliser problems going to be tomorrow's food problems. Many countries are struggling with unsustainable debt. There are trade disruptions,\u201d he noted.",

    "content": "While coronavirus cases are receding across the world, its aftermath is taking shape at both physical and mental levels. A new study reveals that a person going through phases of anxiety, depression, and loneliness before being infected by coronavirus has a much stronger chance of developing long Covid than those who have good mental health.The study conducted by researchers at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health found that psychological distress before Covid-19 infection is associated with an increased risk of long Covid and it was independent of smoking, asthma, and other health behaviors or physical health conditions.\u201cWe were surprised by how strongly psychological distress before a Covid-19 infection was associated with an increased risk of long Covid. Distress was more strongly associated with developing long Covid than physical health risk factors such as obesity, asthma, and hypertension,\u201d Siwen Wang, a researcher in the Department of Nutrition at Harvard Chan School, and lead author of the study said.Also Read | Why India removed Rantac, Zinetac from Essential Medicines List?The findings have been published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry. It states that pre-infection psychological distress was associated with the risk of postCovid-19 conditions.Long Covid in the simplest terms refers to the long-term effects of the SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus, on the body. According to the US-based Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it includes a wide range of ongoing health problems, which can last for days, weeks, and even months after you are diagnosed Covid negative.\"Post-Covid conditions are found more often in people who had severe Covid-19 illness, but anyone who has been infected with the virus that causes Covid-19 can experience post-Covid conditions, even people who had a mild illness or no symptoms from Covid-19,\" CDC notes in its advisory.Also Read | New Omicron subvariant reported in UK. Should you be worried?The study was conducted among 54,000 people in April 2020, who were asked about their psychological distresses at the beginning of the research. Over the next year, 3000 participants became Covid positive and were then asked about symptoms and symptom duration.Analysis of the data revealed that mental distress before Covid-19 infection, including depression, anxiety, worry, perceived stress, and loneliness, was associated with a 32-46 per cent increased risk of long Covid. Mental well-being in the past has been associated with other diseases as well. It is associated with greater severity and longer duration of symptoms in influenza.\u201cWe need to consider psychological health in addition to physical health as risk factors of long Covid-19. These results also reinforce the need to increase public awareness of the importance of mental health and to get mental health care for people who need it,\" Andrea Roberts, senior research scientist and senior author of the JAMA Psychiatry paper, said in a statement.Also Read | What are the effects of Long Covid?

As if the struggle to pay off the gargantuan debt piled up by his firm Future Retail over the years wasn\u2019t enough, the past two years have proved particularly unnerving for him. What seemed like a big relief for his firm when the Mukesh Ambani-promoted Reliance Retail offered to buy his grocery and apparel business for Rs 24,713 crore in August 2020, turned into a nightmare with an ugly legal battle with e-tailer Amazon, which challenged the deal a couple of months later. With a bankruptcy court on July 20 allowing the retail firm\u2019s corporate insolvency, it\u2019s the end of the road for all efforts by the storied retailer to rescue his empire. The twists and turns that marked the past two years as the company got sandwiched between warring giants Reliance Retail and the Jeff Bezos-led Amazon for a big slice of the Indian retail pie are a grim reminder of the extent to which corporate rivalry can sometimes damage businesses. Forrester Research estimates India\u2019s total retail market at $883 billion (Rs 70.4 lakh crore) in 2020. This is projected to grow to $1.4 trillion (Rs 111.6 lakh crore) by 2024.

Desperate people posted to Facebook and other social sites, pleading for rescue for themselves or loved ones.

More than 1.8 million Florida homes and businesses were without electricity, according to PowerOutage.us. Nearly every home and business in three counties was without power.The storm previously tore into Cuba, killing two people and bringing down the country\u2019s electrical grid.About 2.5 million people were ordered to evacuate southwest Florida before Ian hit, but by law no one could be forced to flee.News anchors at Fort Myers television station WINK had to abandon their usual desk and continue storm coverage from another location in their newsroom because water was pushing into their building near the Caloosahatchee River.ALSO READ | Millions in Florida urged to evacuate as Hurricane Ian nearsThough expected to weaken to a tropical storm as it marches inland at about 9 mph (14 kph), Ian\u2019s hurricane force winds were likely to be felt well into central Florida.

DeSantis has also asked Biden to allow FEMA to provide a 100% federal cost share for debris removal and emergency protective measures for 60 days.The governors of Virginia, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina all preemptively declared states of emergency.

    "content": "A week before it tries to launch the Artemis-1 mission to the Moon, in what will be the third attempt, Nasa is in no mood to take any chances. The American space agency will conduct a tanking operation on Wednesday in a bid to check any more leaks and the repairs that have been done following the two scrubbed attempts.The tanking operation involves loading the rocket with fuel that will be used to push the Artemis-1 mission towards the Moon, in what will be set the stage for future crewed missions to the lunar world. The tanking operation will be conducted on the launchpad, where the Space Launch System has remained parked following two scrubbed attempts.\"The demonstration test will allow teams to confirm the repair to a hydrogen leak seen during an early September Artemis I launch attempt, evaluate updated propellant loading procedures, and conduct additional evaluations,\" Nasa said, adding that the demonstration will conclude when the objectives for the test have been met.The third attempt to launch the Artemis-1 on its maiden mission to the Moon has been scheduled on September 27, however, it will now depend on the success of the tanking operation on September 21. If the launch is delayed from September 27, a backup launch window will open up on October 2.Also Read | Jupiter to be closest to Earth in 70 years on this dateThe launch was delayed to September 27 after engineers sought more time for clearing technical and logistical issues with the launch vehicle, which has been on the pad for nearly a month now.

(However)Chaos is unacceptable,\" Raisi said in an interview with state TV, while protests continued around the country.\"The government's red line is our people's security ... One cannot allow people to disturb the peace of society through riots.\"Despite a growing death toll and a fierce crackdown by security forces using tear gas, clubs, and in some cases, live ammunition, social media videos showed Iranians persisting with protests, chanting \"Death to the dictator\".Still, a collapse of the Islamic Republic seems remote in the near term since its leaders are determined not to show the kind of weakness they believe sealed the fate of the U.S.-backed Shah in 1979, a senior Iranian official told Reuters.Angry demonstrations have spread to over 80 cities nationwide since the Sept. 13 death of 22-year-old Amini, after she was arrested for \"unsuitable attire\" by the morality police who enforce the Islamic Republic's strict dress code.ALSO READ| Security forces clash with protestors, over 75 killed as anti-hijab protests intensify in IranAmini, who was from the northwestern Kurdish city of Saqez, died in hospital after falling into a coma, sparking the first big show of dissent on Iran's streets since authorities crushed protests against a rise in gasoline prices in 2019.Raisi, who had ordered an investigation into Amini's death, said \"forensics will present report on her death in the coming days\".Although Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has yet to comment on the protests, a hardline watchdog body called on the judiciary \"to deal decisively with the main perpetrators and those responsible for killing and injuring innocent people and security forces.\"Khamenei appoints six senior clerics of the 12-member body, known as the Guardian Council.State media said 41 people, including members of the police and a pro-government militia, have died during the protests. Iranian human rights groups have reported a higher toll.Raisi backed Iran's security forces, saying \"they sacrifice their lives to secure the country\".Dozens of Iranian celebrities, soccer players and artists - inside and outside the country - have backed the demonstrations.

    "content": "Over two years after Jupiter and Saturn came in line with Earth in a rare planetary conjunction, the former is once again headed towards us. The largest planet in the solar system will be hanging over the skies later this month as it comes closest to Earth in nearly 70 years.Jupiter will be visible in the skies the entire night of September 26 when it reaches opposition. The planet's opposition happens when an astronomical object rises in the east as the Sun sets in the west, placing the object and the Sun on opposite sides of Earth as seen from our home planet.This opposition is special since this will be Jupiter's closest approach to Earth in 70 years. This happens due to the difference in orbit of the two planets around the Sun. Both Jupiter and Earth do not orbit the Sun in perfect circles. It means that the planets will pass each other at different distances throughout the year.During the closest approach on Monday, Jupiter will be over 58 crore kilometers away from us, which at its farthest point from us is 96 crore kilometers away. \"Jupiter\u2019s closest approach to Earth rarely coincides with opposition, which means this year\u2019s views will be extraordinary,\" Nasa said in an update.Also Read | Never seen before Sun Halo appears in skies over MarsWhile the planet will be closest to Earth, it will still be difficult to see it with the naked eyes thanks to the humongous distance between us and the planet.

    "content": "Hurricane Ian plowed into Florida's Gulf Coast with catastrophic force on Wednesday, unleashing howling winds, torrential rains and a treacherous surge of ocean surf that made it one of the most powerful U.S. storms in recent years.Crashing ashore as a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of up to 150 miles per hour (241 kph), Ian quickly transformed an idyllic stretch of sandy beaches and coastal towns into a disaster zone inundated by seawater.Early video images of the storm's fury on local TV and social media showed floodwaters sweeping away cars, nearly reaching rooftops in some communities and the ruins of homes as palm trees were bent almost in half.Up to 30 inches (76 cm) of rain is forecast to fall on parts of central Florida as the storm moves inland, threatening to cause extensive flash floods. Nearly 2 million homes and businesses statewide were without power as of an hour before sunset, utilities reported.\"This storm is doing a number on the state of Florida,\" said Governor Ron DeSantis, who asked U.S. President Joe Biden to approve a major federal disaster declaration providing a wide range of U.S. emergency aid to the entire state.ALSO READ| Reporter almost flown away, sharks on streets: Hurricane Ian lashes Florida | VideoU.S. border authorities said 20 Cuban migrants were missing after their boat sank off the Florida coast as Ian neared the coast on Wednesday.There were no immediate official reports of other storm-related casualties.An unknown number of people were stranded in \"high-risk\" evacuation zones and in need of help after defying orders to seek higher ground, but rescue crews were unable to immediately reach them, the governor said.Having swept past Cuba on Tuesday, leaving it without power for hours, Ian made landfall in Florida at 3:05 p.m. EDT (1905 GMT) on Wednesday near Cayo Costa, a barrier island just west of Fort Myers, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported.The storm's peak wind speeds put it just shy of a Category 5 designation on the Saffir-Simpson scale, the maximum classification.Ian then churned ashore on Florida's mainland, south of the harborside town of Punta Gorda, with slightly diminished winds topping out at 145 mph.DeSantis said Ian had generated life-threatening storm surges - waves of wind-driven seawater rushing in along the coast - of up to 12 feet (3.7 meters) in some places. Forecasters also warned of intense thunderstorms and possible tornadoes.ALSO READ| Millions in Florida urged to evacuate as Hurricane Ian nears\"This is a storm that we will talk about for many years to come, an historic event,\" said Ken Graham, director of the National Weather Service.The sprawling, slow-moving storm pushed farther inland as darkness fell, and within six hours of landfall was downgraded to Category 2, with top sustained winds of 105 mph (170 kmh), the NHC reported.Further weakening was forecast over the next day or so as Ian crosses the Florida peninsula on a northeasterly track, expected to reach the Atlantic Coast on Thursday afternoon.The region around the landfall is home to miles of sandy beaches, scores of resort hotels and numerous mobile home parks, a favorite with retirees and vacationers alike.An hour after landfall, video posted on social media and TV news outlets showed water fueled by storm surges rushing through several communities.The town of Fort Myers Beach was nearly submerged by floodwaters. A view of Sanibel Island posted on Twitter showed the ocean sweeping over a seawall into a resort hotel's swimming pool. Other video from the island showed roads inundated by the storm surge, rising to the tops of street signs.In terms of its sustained wind speeds, which peaked at 155 mph before landfall, Ian ranks as one of the most ferocious hurricanes to strike the U.S. mainland in recent years. By comparison, Hurricane Michael came ashore in Florida's panhandle in 2018 with steady winds of 155 mph, while Ida last year packed sustained winds of 150 mph when it landed in Louisiana.Even as Ian lashed the coast in the final hours before it swept ashore, authorities warned residents it was too late for anyone who had yet to evacuate to safely do so.Earlier this week, more than 2.5 million residents had been told to evacuate. Doug Coe of Venice was one of those who chose to ignore warnings and stay put.\"I'm staying vigilant, but trying not to worry,\" he said.ALSO READ| Hurricane Ian strikes Cuba, Florida braces for category 4 damageMost residents abandoned the area's mobile home parks, taking refuge in local schools and other facilities converted to emergency shelters. The area's numerous assisted-living facilities were mostly evacuated, too.Climate change is making hurricanes wetter, windier and more intense. There is also evidence that it is causing storms to travel more slowly, meaning they can dump more rain in one place, scientists say.",

    "content": "Set for an electoral face-off with Congress veteran Mallikarjun Kharge for the party president's post, Lok Sabha MP Shashi Tharoor on Sunday said he would be open to the idea of a public debate between the candidates as it would evoke people's interest in the party similar to the recent British Conservative Party leadership race.Asked about Tharoor's remarks, Kharge, however, said the two were from the same family and there was no point of holding such a debate. \"I don't want to get into that, I only know how to work, give me an opportunity to do that,\" he said, adding they don't have to fight each other as their struggle is against the BJP.In an interview with PTI, Tharoor also said the Nehru-Gandhi family has held and will always hold a special place in the hearts of Congress party members.He said the answer to the Congress' current challenges lies in a combination of effective leadership and organisational reforms.ALSO READ | Kharge can\u2019t bring change to Congress: Shashi Tharoor makes his case for party chief postKharge and Tharoor were left in the fray in the Congress presidential poll after former Jharkhand minister K N Tripathi's nomination was rejected on Saturday.Talking about what he brings to the table, Tharoor has he has a \"proven and credible track record in leading at the highest levels of organisations, whether it has been at the UN\" or more recently for the Congress party as founder-chairman of the All-India Professionals' Congress.At the UN, Tharoor said, \"as the under-secretary-general in-charge of the body's public information department, I managed the communications of the UN's largest department comprising of over 800 staff in 77 offices worldwide, rationalised its structure, trimmed its budget and sharpened its efforts all of which prompted many to urge me to contest to lead the UN Organisation itself\".Referring to the All-India Professionals' Congress, he said, \"I had to create from scratch and which in just five years since 2017 has over 10, 000 fellows from across 20 states in the country.\"In terms of organisational reforms, the former Union minister said, he has outlined a set of priorities that he believes can help strengthen the Congress and take on the machinery of the BJP.\"Since our current situation is widely deplored, it may be an advantage not to be burdened by the baggage of having spent too much time in the present party organisation and be able to approach it from a fresh perspective,\" the 66-year-old leader said.Asked if he would want a public debate between the party's presidential candidates as is seen in many western democracies and if such an exercise would help delegates make up their minds, Tharoor said, \"I would be open to the idea.\"Tharoor insisted that \"there are no ideological differences among us; rather, it is a question of how we propose to go about achieving the objectives we already agree upon.\"Batting for a public debate, he said between the last date for submission of nominations and the date for polls, there are roughly about two-and-a-half weeks and it would be practically and logistically difficult to reach out to all the 9,000-odd delegates who are eligible to vote in these elections, he argued.\"In that sense, a platform where candidates can exchange their ideas and vision for the party in a constructive manner would potentially facilitate the transmission of these perspectives to more of the delegates than we can reach,\" the Thiruvanthapuram MP said.At the same time, such an exchange of ideas would certainly garner much interest from non-voting sections as well, be it other Congress workers, the media and even the general Indian public, he said.\"As I have often pointed out, an exchange of ideas among candidates could have beneficial effects for the party -- for instance, we have seen the global interest in the British Conservative Party during their recent leadership race, a phenomenon we already witnessed in 2019, when a dozen candidates contested to replace Theresa May and Boris Johnson emerged on top,\" Tharoor said.Replicating a similar scenario will similarly increase the national interest in the Congress party and galvanise more voters towards the party once again, he added.Replying to a query on Tharoor's debate suggestion at a press conference here, Kharge said, \"I don't want to go into this. Whatever I have to say, I will say it clearly.\"There are many people who are intellectual, learned, they may want a debate, I don't want to get into that, I only know how to work, give me an opportunity to do that.\"Kharge further said, \"We are both from the same family. When there are people of the same family, there is no question of fighting against each other. Let us fight together against those who are promoting inflation, unemployment, creating conflict among people, who are making people of one religion fight with the other, who are making people fight in the name of language.\"Even after the election, all the people have to work together and strengthen the principles of Congress, he asserted, adding that Tharoor and he were from one family and there was no point of debate.\"Our struggle is with the BJP, with Modi-Shah. We both have to work together,\" he added.Salman Soz, who was a proposer for Tharoor, in a tweet said the Lok Sabha MP is open to a public debate with Kharge ji, should both sides agree.\"A public debate would attract a lot of attention for Congress and would help Congress delegates and the public get a sense of the vision & plans of these leaders,\" he saidAsked if a non-Gandhi president was on the cards for the Congress and whether the Gandhi family would continue to occupy a place of pre-eminence, Tharoor said, \"Obviously, the Nehru-Gandhi family has held and will always hold a special place in the hearts of Congress party members and with good reason too.\"Aside from the great legacy they have inherited from their illustrious forebears, they have consistently brought together the various groups, ideologies, geographies and communities that collectively make up the fabric of the Congress party, he asserted.\"They also have a great record of success and experience in leading the party, both when in government and during tough times in the wilderness, when they have still managed to rally the men and women of the Congress together,\" he said.\"Let us not forget the magnitude of what they have achieved for the party \u2014 or the ultimate sacrifice paid by two former presidents from the family,\" he added.Tharoor further said, \"This is why many of us had expressed both publicly and in private our hope that Rahul Gandhi would resume his leadership, an outcome that would undoubtedly be the most popular among the rank and file of the party.\"He said now that it appears unlikely to happen, he hopes that the family will recognise that they are and remain the foundational pillar of the Congress, moral conscience and ultimate guiding spirit.They cannot and must not withdraw from that role, whatever the formal designations they choose to retain, he said.Tharoor had said on Friday that he is aware of his underdog tag and talk of an 'official candidate' in some quarters but he has been assured by the Gandhi family Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra repeatedly that they are \"neither directly nor indirectly\" backing anyone.According to a notification issued by Congress, the process for filing nominations for the election was from September 24 to 30.The date for scrutiny of the nomination papers was on October 1, while the last date for withdrawal of nominations is October 8.The final list of candidates will be published at 5 pm on October 8. The polling, if needed, will be held on October 17. The counting of votes will be taken up on October 19 and the results will be declared the same day.More than 9,000 Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) delegates will vote in the poll.ALSO READ | Won't betray people, says Tharoor as buzz over 'official candidate' Kharge gains momentum",

    "content": "A leaked audio tape purportedly of Pakistan's former prime minister Imran Khan has surfaced in which he is talking about how to exploit the controversial cypher to portray his ouster in April as a conspiracy.The clip making rounds on social media features a conversation between Khan and his then principal secretary Azam Khan about a cypher sent by the Pakistan ambassador in Washington about his meeting with a US official.Khan, also chairman of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, was ousted from power in April after losing a no-confidence vote in his leadership, which he alleged was part of a US-led conspiracy targeting him because of his independent foreign policy decisions on Russia, China and Afghanistan.US Assistant Secretary of State for Central and South Asia Donald Lu was the central figure in Khan\u2019s claims about a US-backed regime-change conspiracy.He accused Lu of threatening Pakistan\u2019s former ambassador to the US, Asad Majeed, that a failure to remove Khan through a no-confidence vote would herald \u201cconsequences\u201d for Pakistan and vice versa.In the leaked audio, Khan is heard as saying: \u201cWe only have to play on this (cypher). We don\u2019t have to name [any country]. We only have to play with this, that this date (of no-trust motion) was [decided] before (it was moved against him).\u201dThe second voice is apparently of Azam Khan who is heard as suggesting holding a meeting on the cypher.\u201cSee, if you recall, in that the ambassador has written in the end to [send] a demarche. Even if the demarche is not to be sent, as I have thought a lot about it at night \u2014 you said they raised it \u2014 I thought about how to cover all this.\u201cLet\u2019s hold a meeting with Shah Mahmood Qureshi (who was the foreign minister in Imran\u2019s government) and the foreign secretary. Shah Mahmood Qureshi will read out that letter and whatever he reads out will be converted into a copy. I will then make minutes [out of it and say] that the foreign secretary has prepared this.\u201cBut its (cypher\u2019s) analysis will have to be conducted here. We will carry out the analysis and convert it into minutes as we want so that it becomes [part of] the official record,\u201d says the former principal secretary.He further explains that the analysis would conclude that \u201cit is a threat. It is called a threat in diplomatic language\u201d.Azam Khan also says that the minutes of the suggested meeting would be prepared by him and he also later on in the conversation suggests that the entire issue would become part of the bureaucratic record instead of being a political issue.Khan used the cypher to portray his downfall in April as a conspiracy by the US and widely use this narrative in public rallies. He also calls the current government \u201cimported\u201d.The cricketer-turned-politician, who came to power in 2018, is the only Pakistani Prime Minister to be ousted in a no-confidence vote in Parliament.The US has denied any role in his ouster.However, the audio shows that he was trying to exploit a simple diplomatic communication for political mileage.Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf party has not reacted to the leak formally but when Khan was asked by journalists about what he meant by playing with the cypher. He said: \u201cI have not started playing yet.\u201dHe also said that the cypher issue should be properly investigated.Meanwhile, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry addressed the latest leaks but did not confirm or deny its veracity, the Dawn newspaper reported.Chaudhry said in a tweet that the only thing that the new leak confirmed was that \u201cefforts were made to hide the US cypher from the [former] prime minister\u201d.The leak is the latest in the string of audio tapes of conversations recorded in the Prime Minister's House. The earlier clips were about the leaders of the current government.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday announced that a panel would be formed to probe the matter while he also called a meeting of the high-profile National Security Committee (NSC) to discuss the security breach resulting in the secret conversation going public.",

The SUV-sized rover has witnessed a sun halo, a unique feature that has been seen time and again in the skies over Earth.The Sun halo as seen on Earth is a 22-degree ring that appears due to the dispersion of light as white light passes through ice crystals found in upper-level cirrus clouds, causing the halo to have colours. Scientists have been hoping to see a similar phenomenon in the skies over Mars. However, they hadn't seen the phenomenon so far.Not anymore.Also Read | Did Perseverance rover just find the first signs of life on Mars?The Perseverance rover picked up the unique development happening in the skies on December 15, 2021, giving scientists a rare view into the complexity of the Martian atmosphere. \"Perseverance really surprised us with some of the images that we got back in December,\" Mark Lemmon, a planetary scientist at the Space Science Institute told space.com.On Earth, the clouds contain millions of tiny ice crystals, which refract, split, and even reflect the light to give an impression of a circular rainbow ring. The crystals have to be oriented and positioned just so with respect to your eye, in order for the halo to appear. Light undergoes two refractions as it passes through the ice crystals and the bending that occurs depends on the ice crystal's diameter.According to the University of Illinois, \"The halo is a ring of light 22 degrees from the Sun or Moon and is the most common type of halo observed and formed by hexagonal ice crystals.\"Also Read | Scientists discover new culprit behind Ozone depletionUnlike Earth, the Martian atmosphere has a higher content of carbon dioxide than water, which forced the team to rethink if the image was indeed of a Sun halo or whether it was the Perseverance camera that created the bright ring.The team confirmed it was not dust that led to the formation of the ring on the image.\"We've got a lot of pictures that show you what kind of features you get from dust in the sky, and we know for sure that you never get a halo from that,\" Lemmon told space.com.Also Read | Earth could be even friendlier to life if Jupiter...",

So far, 69 bodies have been recovered, including one on Wednesday, confirmed the local administration.On September 25, people from the Hindu community were going from Aulia Ghat towards Badheshwar temple to offer prayers on the occasion of Mahalaya when the boat overturned in the middle of the river due to overcrowding. According to locals and rescued passengers, over 50 people had taken the boat.Meanwhile, the investigation committee of the district administration formed to probe the incident will take another three days to submit its report.Also Read: 24 killed in Bangladesh on way to Mahalaya ceremony after boat capsizes on Karatoya riverAdditional district magistrate and head of the investigation committee Dipankar Roy said he, along with other members of the committee, were supervising a lot of things such as monitoring the rescue activities, handing over the bodies to the families and assisting in cremation. Because of this, there has been some disruption in the investigation process. Panchagarh district magistrate Mohammed Zahurul Islam confirmed the matter.According to the emergency information and support center of the district administration established at the Marea Union Parishad office, 69 bodies recovered till Wednesday evening have been handed over to the respective families.Railways minister Nurul Islam Sujan visited the accident spot in Auliar Ghat area under Maria Union Parishad of Boda Upazila (an administrative region in Bangladesh functioning as a sub-unit of a district) on Tuesday to take stock of the situation.While addressing reporters, the minister assured support to kin of all those who died in the boat capsize incident. \"The family members of the deceased will be given necessary assistance,\" he said.Terming the boat capsize as an accident, the minister further said, \"All preparations have been made for the construction of a bridge over Karotoya in Aulia Ghat area. The project has also been approved. Once a bridge is in place, there will not be such loss of lives.\"Between 2018 and 2022, there have been 3,500 accidents in Bangladesh involving launches and ships, which have claimed more than 3,000 lives.Stakeholders said overcrowding, lack of fitness of the boats, bad weather and unskilled drivers are the reasons why there are so many accidents involving launches and boats.The biggest accident in the history of Bangladesh occurred on July 8, 2003. A launch named MV Nasrin-1, which was going from Dhaka to Lalmohan in Bhola, sank in the estuary of the Meghna and Dakatiya rivers in Chandpur. The Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority said the floor of the launch broke due to the excess weight of the cargo and passengers.

    "content": "Preparations are underway at full steam in Gwalior, and the Kunno National Park in Seopur for the arrival of Cheetahs in what is one of the world's biggest wildlife translocation projects. Eight cheetahs will be flown from the Savannas in Nambia to the National Park, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi will introduce them to the Indian wildlife.A special customised B747 Jumbo Jet will ferry Big Cat to Gwalior from where Chinook helicopters of the Indian Air Force (IAF) will lift them and bring them to their new home at the Kunno National Park. The eight cheetahs include five females and three males. While the females are aged between two and five years, the male cheetahs are 4.5 years and 5.5 years.Before these new animals begin their life in India, here's a refresher on this unique animal species that remains the top predator on their food chain.The Cheetah, the scientific name Acinonyx jubatus, is the world's fastest land animal. Why fastest? The Big Cat is a model of aerodynamic supremacy and can accelerate from zero to 100 kilometers per hour in a matter of 3 seconds. That speed is enough to put any sports car to shame. However, there are limitations to that speed. According to National Geography, they can sustain that staggering speed for just 30 seconds.But then, that's enough to kill the unsuspecting prey.Also Read | Stage set for return of cheetahs to IndiaHowever, that's not enough, the animal has unique structural adaptations that add to its pace advantage on the circuit. These include a small collarbone and hips on a flexible spine that provide it with a longer stride compared to a tiger or a jaguar. Meanwhile, their elongated retinal fovea provides a sharp vision that plays a crucial role in speed and time management.A PERFECT CAMOUFLAGEAccording to the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, Cheetahs are characterized by their slender, long-legged bodies with blunt, semi-retractable claws with their heads being smaller than their eyes. The adult Cheetahs adorn yellow or tan short, coarse fur with solid black, round or oval spots. However, the tail differs with four to six black rings and a bushy white or black tuft.These unique patterns make it highly adaptable to the Savannas where the fur acts as camouflage, providing it a perfect blend with its environment and an apt position for hunting. Where it excels in speed, it has some vulnerabilities when it comes to fighting. The animal lacks big teeth as compared to tigers or lions which makes it a weak fighter within its own species.The natural habitat of the cheetah is found in North Africa, the Sahel, and eastern and southern Africa. The animal can survive in a range of habitats but prosper the most in open grasslands. In Namibia, these animals have been found to be living in savannahs, dense vegetation, and mountainous terrain.The animal was once found in India but has been extinct since the early 1950s. The species has been badly hit and nearly 13 countries have reported their extinction. Cheetahs are carnivorous and are known to specialise in hunting during early mornings and late afternoons.Also Read | Why details of the cheetahs coming to India are crucial for success of the introduction programmeAccording to the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, the animal preys on springbok, steenbok, duikers, impala and gazelles, apart from hartebeest, oryx, roan and sable.The closest rival of cheetahs when it comes to speed is the Jaguar, which can accelerate at a pace of 80 kilometers per hour. While Cheetahs are found in the African Savannah, jaguars mostly inhabit tropical low-lying habitats close to lakes, rivers, and inland wetlands. Jaguars can be found from the southwestern USA to the scrub grasslands of Argentina.Where jaguars lack, Tiger has an advantage, the animal is an expert hunter and can run at a speed of over 60 kilometers per hour. The largest of all the Asian big cats, they have excellent sight and hearing capabilities and are found in India, Russia, and Indonesia, among other countries. Tigers remain an endangered species in the world, however, their population has seen a significant jump in India.Also Read | 4-legged commandos to protect cheetahs from poachersCougars, scientific name Puma concolor, are a powerful predator that remains elusive to sightings thanks to their habitats in mountainous terrain. The animal can trek at a speed of 80 kilometers per hour and are limited to Florida swamps and Canadian forests. Unlike Cheetahs, cougars are solitary animals and do not on good terms with their kin. They have no role in raising or protecting their kids.With Cheetahs now arriving in India, all eyes are set on the project that aims to repopulate the animal in the Indian wildlife, which has remained extinct for over half a century.Also Read | Cheetah is back: B747 Jumbo sporting Big Cat motif lands in Namibia to ferry world's fastest animal",

The office of Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, who is in charge of oil and gas, also did not immediately respond.Azizi said the agreement would run for an unspecified trial period, after which both sides were expected to sign a longer term deal if they were content with the arrangement.He declined to give details on pricing or payment methods, but said Russia had agreed to a discount to global markets on goods that would be delivered to Afghanistan by road and rail.The deal was finalised after an Afghan technical team spent several weeks in discussions in Moscow, having stayed on afterAzizi visited there last month.Since the Taliban regained power, Afghanistan has been plunged into economic crisis after development aid upon which the country relied was cut and amid sanctions that have largely frozen the banking sector.The trade deal is likely to be watched closely in the United States, whose officials have held regular talks with the Taliban on plans for the country's banking system.Washington has announced the creation of a Swiss trust fund for some of the Afghan central bank reserves held in the United States. The Taliban have demanded the release of the entire amount of around $7 billion and said the funds should be used for central bank operations.Azizi said international data showed most Afghans were living below the poverty line, and his office was working to support trade and the economy through international outreach.\"Afghans are in great need,\" he said. \"Whatever we do, we do it based on national interest and the people's benefit.\"He said Afghanistan also received some gas and oil from Iran and Turkmenistan and had strong trade ties with Pakistan, but also wanted to diversify.\"A country ... shouldn't be dependent on just one country, we should have alternative ways,\" he said.The Group of Seven (G7) nations are trying to find ways to limit Russia's oil export earnings in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine in February.Moscow has managed to maintain revenues through increased crude sales to Asia, particularly China and India.

    "content": "Scientists in Australia have unearthed beautifully preserved fossilized hearts and other internal organs of ancient armored fish in a discovery that provides insight into the evolution of the bodies of vertebrates - including humans.The researchers on Thursday described the heart, the organ that pumps blood through the body's circulatory system, in fish called placoderms that inhabited a tropical reef about 380 million years ago during the Devonian Period. The fossils were 250 million years older than any previously known fish heart.The fossilized liver, stomach and intestine from these placoderms helped give a fuller view of the internal anatomy at a pivotal time in the history of vertebrates - backboned animals including fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.The fossils were found in a locale called the Gogo Formation in Western Australia's Kimberley region near the town of Fitzroy Crossing. They are remarkable because soft tissue, unlike hard stuff such as bones and teeth, is rarely preserved as fossils and even less often preserved in a robust three dimensions, as these are, rather than flattened.\"The site is without a doubt one of the world's most important fossil sites for understanding the early evolution of backboned animals, including the origins of the human body plan,\" said vertebrate paleontologist Kate Trinajstic of Curtin University and the Western Australian Museum, lead author of the study published in the journal Science.Also Read | When life began and then suddenly ended in Earth's oceansPlacoderms, known for bony armor on the head and neck, represented \"our earliest jawed ancestors,\" Trinajstic said.The newly described fossils are of two species, named Compagopiscis croucheri and Incisoscutum ritchiei, both about 10 inches (25 cm) long with shark-like asymmetrical tail fins, jaws bearing teeth and blade-like cutting edges, and broad, blunt-nosed heads.The placoderms had an S-shaped heart similar to that of a shark. It was made up of two chambers, with a smaller one on top and a larger one underneath, and was located at the front of the shoulder girdle in a similar position to sharks and bony fish today. Its structure differs from later vertebrates. Amphibians and reptiles have a three-chambered heart, while mammals and birds have a four-chambered heart.In land vertebrates, which evolved from fish during the Devonian, the heart has moved further back along the body - or down from the perspective of upright humans. If a person's heart was in the same place as these placoderms, it would be at the base of the throat between the collar bones.The placoderm liver was large and enabled the fish to remain buoyant, as in sharks. The liver showed how placoderms had evolved away from the organ arrangement of jawless fish. In jawless fish called lampreys, the liver is squashed against the heart and envelops it from behind. The placoderms displayed a heart-liver separation like modern jawed vertebrates.Also Read | Ancient skeleton found in Mexico cave that flooded at end of the ice ageThe placoderm stomach, shaped like a flattened and somewhat rectangular bag, has a distinctive wall texture, thick and honeycombed, apparently representing glandular tissue. The intestine has spiral valves to help with food absorption. There was no evidence of lungs.The single biggest step in the evolution of vertebrates was the transition from the ancestral jawless condition, reflected in modern lampreys and hagfish, to the jawed vertebrate body plan, said paleontologist and study co-author Per Ahlberg of the University of Uppsala in Sweden.\"Today, the overwhelming majority of vertebrates belong to the jawed group: sharks, rays, bony fishes and all land vertebrates including humans. This transition didn't just involve the evolution of jaws, but also all kinds of changes in the soft anatomy - for example the evolution of a stomach, and the heart moving forward into the throat region,\" Ahlberg said.\"But while fossils give us a reasonably complete picture of the evolution of the skeleton, the equally important soft organs usually don't fossilize at all, which means that we are left guessing about the details of their evolutionary transformation,\" Ahlberg added.Also Read | New blood test detects multiple cancers without symptoms",

He also has 40 grandchildren from them.Speaking to Yasir Shami of Daily Pakistan Global, he explained that all his previous marriages came to an end by the death of his 'wives'.Therefore, when the time for marrying off his eighth daughter came, his progenies decided to find a 'suitable' match for him and get him married on the same day so that he doesn't feel lonely once she leaves to begin a new life with her husband.Upon being asked about marriage, Shaukat said that age isn't a big factor as one should be 'young from the heart'.",

    "content": "Climate change likely juiced rainfall by up to 50% late last month in two southern Pakistan provinces, but global warming wasn\u2019t the biggest cause of the country\u2019s catastrophic flooding that has killed more than 1,500 people, a new scientific analysis finds.Pakistan\u2019s overall vulnerability, including people living in harm\u2019s way, is the chief factor in the disaster that at one point submerged one-third of the country under water, but human-caused \u201cclimate change also plays a really important role here,\u201d said study senior author Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College of London.There are many ingredients to the still ongoing humanitarian crisis \u2014 some meteorological, some economic, some societal, some historic and construction oriented. Add to that weather records that don\u2019t go back far enough in time.With such complications and limitations, the team of international scientists looking at the disaster couldn\u2019t quantify how much climate change had increased the likelihood and frequency of the flooding, said authors of the study. It was released Thursday but not yet peer reviewed.Also Read | Climate impacts heading to uncharted territories of destruction, says UN chiefWhat happened \u201cwould have been a disastrously high rainfall event without climate change, but it\u2019s worse because of climate change,\u201d Otto said. \u201cAnd especially in this highly vulnerable region, small changes matter a lot.\u201dBut other human factors that put people in harm\u2019s way and weren\u2019t adequate to control the water were even bigger influences.\u201cThis disaster was the result of vulnerability that was constructed over many, many years,\u201d said study team member Ayesha Siddiqi of the University of Cambridge.August rainfall in the Sindh and Balochistan provinces -- together nearly the size of Spain -- was eight and nearly seven times normal amounts, while the country as a whole had three-and-a-half times its normal rainfall, according to the report by World Weather Attribution, a collection of mostly volunteer scientists from around the world who do real-time studies of extreme weather to look for the fingerprints of climate change.The team looked at just the two provinces over five days and saw an increase of up to 50% in the intensity of rainfall that was likely due to climate change. They also looked at the entire Indus region over two months and saw up to a 30% increase in rainfall there.Also Read | Warning bells of extreme climate events we face today rang a decade agoThe scientists not only examined records of past rains, which only go back to 1961, but they used computer simulations to compare what happened last month to what would have happened in a world without heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas \u2014 and that difference is what they could attribute to climate change. This is a scientifically valid technique, according to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.Study co-author Fahad Saeed, a climate scientist at Climate Analytics and the Center for Climate Change and Sustainable Development in Islamabad, Pakistan, said numerous factors made this monsoon season much wetter than normal, including a La Nina, the natural cooling of part of the Pacific that alters weather worldwide.But other factors had the signature of climate change, Saeed said. A nasty heat wave in the region earlier in the summer -- which was made 30 times more likely because of climate change -- increased the differential between land and water temperatures. That differential determines how much moisture goes from the ocean to the monsoon and means more of it drops.And climate change seemed to slightly change the jet stream, storm tracks and where low pressure sits, bringing more rainfall for southern provinces than they usually get, Saeed said.Also Read | Why should melting Himalayas scare you? Look at Pakistan\u201cPakistan has not contributed much in terms of causing global climate change, but sure is having to deal with a massive amount of climate change consequences,\u201d said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, who wasn\u2019t part of the study.Overpeck and three other outside climate scientists said the study makes sense and is nuanced properly to bring in all risk factors.The nuances help \u201cavoid overinterpretation,\u201d said Stanford University climate scientist Chris Field. \u201cBut we also want to avoid missing the main message -- human-caused climate change is increasing the risks of extreme events around the world, including the devastating 2022 Pakistan flooding.\u201dAlso Read | Explained: Pakistan fatal flooding has hallmarks of global warming",

    "content": "About 1.3 billion kilometers away from Earth, a world in the vacuum of space remains the biggest attraction, not for its humongous size but for a series of rings that go around it. For decades these rings have baffled astronomers, who continue to look for answers to their origin and why the planet is tilted on its axis.A new study now reveals a violent and deadly past that gave it its rings and a tilt that was initially believed to be from gravitational interactions with its neighbor Neptune.The rings might have come from a Moon, that now does not exist.Planetary researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have revealed that the planet, which today has 83 moons, once harbored at least one more, an extra satellite that they name Chrysalis. The team developed a new model to test the hypothesis of the missing satellite.Chrysalis is believed to have been orbiting Saturn for billions of years accompanying its massive catalogue of natural satellites while pulling and tugging on the planet in a way that kept its tilt, or \u201cobliquity,\u201d in resonance with Neptune. However, things went bad about 160 million years ago.Also Read | Did Perseverance rover just find the first signs of life on Mars?MIT researchers estimate that the Moon became unstable and came dangerously close to its planet in a grazing encounter that pulled the satellite apart. While the violent destruction was enough to remove Saturn from Neptune\u2019s grasp, a fraction of its fragments could have remained suspended in orbit. These small icy chunks today form the planet's iconic rings.\u201cJust like a butterfly\u2019s chrysalis, this satellite was long dormant and suddenly became active, and the rings emerged,\" Jack Wisdom, professor of planetary sciences at MIT, and lead author of the new study, said in a statement.The new analysis has its roots in the observations made by the Cassini spacecraft between 2004-2017 and which revealed that Titan, Saturn\u2019s largest satellite, was migrating away from Saturn at a faster clip than expected, at a rate of about 11 centimeters per year.MIT in its release stated that Titan\u2019s fast migration, and its gravitational pull, led scientists to conclude that the moon was likely responsible for tilting and keeping Saturn in resonance with Neptune. The team of researchers used Cassini's \"Grand Finale,\" a phase in which the probe mapped the gravitational field of Saturn.Also Read | Scientists discover new culprit behind Ozone depletionAnalysis of this field placed Saturn close to, but just outside the resonance with Neptune. The planets may have once been in sync, but are no longer. The tilt was due to the loss of the satellite that triggered it away from Neptune and led to the formation of rings between 200 and 100 million years ago.\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good story, but like any other result, it will have to be examined by others. But it seems that this lost satellite was just a chrysalis, waiting to have its instability,\u201d Jack Wisdom said.The study has been published in the journal Science.Also Read | A new space race?

Forecasts for the latest quarter range from 9.0 per cent to 21.5 per cent.However, India's consumer spending was hit hard following a rise in food and fuel prices.The government, along with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has been able to reign in over inflation over the past three months. Consumer spending accounts for nearly 55 per cent of economic activity.The RBI expects the real GDP growth projection for 2022-23 to stand at 7.2 per cent.The GDP is estimated to rise 15.4 per cent in Q1 than in the same quarter a year ago, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. That\u2019s the fastest reading since the April-June quarter of 2021 and compared with the 4.09 per cent expansion in the previous three months.According to Bibek Debroy, chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to prime minister, India's annual per capita income will be over $10,000 if the country grows at an average economic growth rate of 7.0-7.5 per cent in the next 25 years.\"I don't think we will miss the nominal GDP growth rate envisaged in the budget. Yes, right now the geopolitical situation is somewhat maligned. In this situation, India is relatively one of the better performing countries,\" he said.This year's budget pegged the economy to grow to Rs 258 trillion in nominal terms during 2022-23, against Rs 232 trillion in the previous year.Ritika Chhabra, economist and quant analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher, expects India\u2019s GDP to grow by 14.0 per cent-14.5 per cent on year in the fiscal first quarter ending June.Bloomberg survey estimates GDP at 15.4 per cent.State Bank of India (SBI) sees a 15.7 per cent growth.According to Morgan Stanley, India is likely to be the fastest-growing Asian economy in 2022-23.",

Nasa in a briefing has said that the SUV-sized rover has picked up the most organic-rich material from the crater.However, it does not mean there could have beenl ife. It simply means there could be chances of some unique discoveries hiding in the future when these samples arrive on Earth in the final years of this decade or the early years of the next. The rover has collected four samples from the ancient river delta, which is believed to be the top prospect for finding signs of ancient microbial life.\u201cThe delta, with its diverse sedimentary rocks, contrasts beautifully with the igneous rocks formed from crystallization of magma discovered on the crater floor. This juxtaposition provides us with a rich understanding of the geologic history after the crater formed and a diverse sample suite. For example, we found a sandstone that carries grains and rock fragments created far from Jezero Crater and a mudstone that includes intriguing organic compounds,\u201d Perseverance project scientist Ken Farley said.It is known that organic molecules contain a wide variety of compounds made primarily of carbon and usually include hydrogen and oxygen atoms. These molecules also contain nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, and the presence of these specific molecules is considered to be a potential biosignature a substance or structure that could be evidence of past life.Also Read | Isro looking to develop simulator to train astronauts for Gaganyaan missionThe rover in July drilled on a unique rock that has been on Mars for billions of years. Dubbed Wildcat Ridge, the rock formed billions of years ago as mud and fine sand settled in an evaporating saltwater lake. The rover abraded some of the surfaces of Wildcat Ridge to analyse with Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals (SHERLOC).What it found was a class of organic molecules that are spatially correlated with those of sulfate minerals. Nasa said that sulfate minerals found in layers of sedimentary rock can yield significant information about the aqueous environments in which they formed.\u201cIn the distant past, the sand, mud, and salts that now make up the Wildcat Ridge sample were deposited under conditions where life could potentially have thrived. The fact the organic matter was found in such a sedimentary rock known for preserving fossils of ancient life here on Earth is important. However, as capable as our instruments aboard Perseverance is, further conclusions regarding what is contained in the Wildcat Ridge sample will have to wait until it\u2019s returned to Earth for in-depth study as part of the agency\u2019s Mars Sample Return campaign,\u201d Farley added.Scientists are excited to analyse these rock samples when it arrives on Earth in the later years of this decade as a global program has been put in place to launch missions to the Red Planet o retrieve these samples.Also Read | When life began and then suddenly ended in Earth's oceans",

While the role of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) has been widely established, an international team of researchers has found a new element that is damaging the Ozone over the Arctic.The new culprit is Iodine.Over a hundred researchers from 20 countries, including the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, in collaboration with Extreme Environments Research Laboratory, Switzerland, The Cyprus Institute, and NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory, joined hands to analyse the changes in the Arctic. The researchers found that the chemical reactions between Iodine and Ozone were the second highest contributor to the loss of surface Ozone.READ | Volcanic eruptions may destroy ozone layer, doom Earth: Climate simulation stuns scientistsTheir findings have been published in the journal Nature Geosciences after the observations were conducted by the researchers during the ship-based Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition. The new findings are set to change the decades-old paradigm on the drivers of Arctic photochemical Ozone loss.The Ozone layer is found in the troposphere, the lower 10 kilometers of the atmosphere, and in the stratosphere that extends 10-50 km above the ground. According to the World Meteorological Department, Ozone is a form of oxygen with molecules carrying three atoms instead of two and acts as a shield protecting us against harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.The Ozone has been under attack from chlorine (chlorofluorocarbon, CFC) and bromine (halon) compounds that were largely being used in refrigerants, pesticides, solvents, and fire extinguishers. This led to the development of a major hole in the Ozone layer, which has since then closed.ALSO READ | This year's ozone hole is eight times bigger than India, set to last through November\"The main driver for this is the anthropogenic emissions of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). However, similar, but shorter-lived, ozone depletion events are seen close to the surface of the Earth,\" IITM said in a statement, adding that during these depletion events, ozone concentrations drop to nearly zero.The team of researchers conducted observations from March to October 2020 on a ship in the high Arctic region and found that Iodine enhances springtime tropospheric Ozone depletion. They developed a chemical model to show that chemical reactions between Iodine and Ozone are the second highest contributor to the loss of surface Ozone.ALSO READ | New global review of regulatory approaches to implement regional action releasedThe study further suggests that the atmospheric increase in Iodine loading due to enhanced anthropogenic Ozone-induced ocean Iodine emissions, as well as the thinning and shrinking of Arctic sea ice expected in the near future, will probably lead to increases in Iodine emissions.\"These results indicate that iodine chemistry could play an increasingly important role in the future and must be considered for accurate quantification of the ozone budget in the Arctic,\" IITM said in a release.",

Strategic rivalry with China\u2019s ambitious space program is helping drive NASA\u2019s effort to get back into space in a bigger way, as both nations push to put people back on the moon and establish the first lunar bases.American intelligence, military and political leaders make clear they see a host of strategic challenges to the U.S. in China\u2019s space program, in an echo of the U.S.-Soviet rivalry that prompted the 1960s\u2019 race to the moon. That\u2019s as China is quickly matching U.S. civil and military space accomplishments and notching new ones of its own.On the military side, the U.S. and China trade accusations of weaponizing space. Senior U.S. defense officials warn that China and Russia are building capabilities to take out the satellite systems that underpin U.S. intelligence, military communications and early warning networks.Also Read | WATCH | Meteor lights up Glasgow, turns night sky greenThere\u2019s also a civilian side to the space race. The U.S. is wary of China taking the lead in space exploration and commercial exploitation, and pioneering the technological and scientific advances that would put China ahead in power in space and in prestige down on Earth.\u201cIn a decade, the United States has gone from the unquestioned leader in space to merely one of two peers in a competition,\u201d Sen. Jim Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, declared this week at a Senate Armed Services hearing. \u201cEverything our military does relies on space.\u201dAt another hearing last year, NASA administrator Bill Nelson brandished an image transmitted by a Chinese rover that had just plunked down on Mars. \u201cThe Chinese government ... they\u2019re going to be landing humans on the moon\u201d soon, he said. \u201cThat should tell us something about our need to get off our duff.\u201dNASA, the U.S. civilian space agency, is awaiting a new launch date this month or in October for its Artemis 1 uncrewed test moonshot. Technical problems scrubbed the first two launch attempts in recent weeks.China likewise aims to send astronauts to the moon this decade, as well as establish a robotic research station there. Both the U.S. and China intend to establish bases for intermittent crews on the moon\u2019s south pole after that.Russia has aligned with China\u2019s moon program, while 21 nations have joined a U.S.-initiated effort meant to bring guidelines and order to the civil exploration and development of space.The parallel efforts come 50 years after U.S. astronauts last pulled shut the doors on an Apollo module and blasted away from the moon, in December 1972.Also Read | Asteroid bigger than Statue of Unity headed towards Earth this weekSome space policy experts bat down talk of a new space race, seeing big differences from John F. Kennedy\u2019s Cold War drive to outdo the Soviet Union\u2019s Sputnik and be the first to get people on the moon. This time, both the U.S. and China see moon programs as a stepping stone in phased programs toward exploring, settling and potentially exploiting the resources and other untapped economic and strategic opportunities offered by the moon, Mars and space at large.Beyond the gains in technology, science and jobs that accompany space programs, Artemis promoters point to the potential of mining minerals and frozen water on the moon, or using the moon as a base to go prospecting on asteroids \u2014 the Trump administration in particular emphasized the mining prospects. There\u2019s potential in tourism and other commercial efforts.And for space more broadly, Americans alone have tens of thousands of satellites overhead in what the Space Force says is a half-trillion dollar global space economy. Satellites guide GPS, process credit card purchases, help keep TV, radio and cell phone feeds going, and predict weather. They ensure the military and intelligence community\u2019s ability to keep track of perceived threats.And in a world where China and Russia are collaborating to try to surpass the U.S. in space, and where some point to private space efforts led by U.S. billionaires as rendering costly NASA rocket launches unnecessary, the U.S. would regret leaving the glory and strategic advantages from developing the moon and space solely to the likes of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Tesla magnate Elon Musk, Artemis proponents say.The moon programs signal that \u201cspace is going to be an arena of competition on the prestige front, demonstrating advanced technical expertise and know-how, and then also on the military front as well,\u201d said Aaron Bateman, a professor of history and international affairs at George Washington University and a member of the Space Policy Institute.\u201cPeople who are supportive of Artemis and people who see it as a tool of competition, they want the United States to be at the table in shaping the future of exploration on other celestial bodies,\u201d Bateman said.There\u2019s no shortage of such warnings as the Artemis program moves toward lift-off. \u201cBeijing is working to match or exceed U.S. capabilities in space to gain the military, economic, and prestige benefits that Washington has accrued from space leadership,\u201d the U.S. intelligence community warned this year in its annual threat assessment.A Pentagon-commissioned study group contended last month that \u201cChina appears to be on track to surpass the U.S. as the dominant space power by 2045.\u201d It called that part of a Chinese plan to promote authoritarianism and communism down here on Earth.It\u2019s sparked occasional heated words between Chinese and U.S. officials.Also Read | Astronaut Samantha to become first European female commander of Space StationChina\u2019s space program was guided by peaceable principles, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said in July. \u201cSome U.S. officials are constantly smearing China\u2019s normal and reasonable outer space undertakings,\u201d Zhao said.Flying on the mightiest rocket ever built by NASA, Artemis 1 aims for a five-week demo flight that would put test dummies into lunar orbit.If all goes well with that, U.S. astronauts could fly around the moon in 2024 and land on it in 2025, culminating a program that will have cost $93 billion over more than a decade of work.NASA intends that a woman and a person of color will be on the first U.S. crew touching foot on the moon again.Lessons learned in getting back to the moon will aid in the next step in crewed flights, to Mars, the space agency says.China\u2019s ambitious space program, meanwhile, is a generation behind that of the United States. But its secretive, military-linked program is developing fast and creating distinctive missions that could put Beijing on the leading edge of space flight.Already, China has that rover on Mars, joining U.S. ones already there. China carved out a first with its landing on the far side of the moon.Chinese astronauts are overhead now, putting the finishing touches on a permanent orbiting space station.Also Read | What are the effects of Long Covid? Expert answersA 1967 U.N. space treaty meant to start shaping the guardrails for space exploration bans anyone from claiming sovereignty over a celestial body, putting a military base on it, or putting weapons of mass destruction into space.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s at all by coincidence or happenstance that it is now in this period of what people are claiming is renewed great-power competition that the United States is actually investing the resources to go back,\u201d said Bateman, the scholar on space and national security. \u201cTime will tell if this turns into a sustained program.\u201dCompetition isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, said Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.Does rivalry with the Chinese \u201censure greater sustained interest in our space program? Sure,\u201d Coons said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily a competition that leads to conflict.\u201cI think it can be a competition \u2014 like the Olympics \u2014 that simply means that each team and each side is going to push higher and faster. And as a result, humanity is likely to benefit,\u201d he said.Also Read | When life began and then suddenly ended in Earth's oceans",

    "content": "Propaganda videos showing how happily Uyghurs are living under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are repeatedly being shared using fake accounts on YouTube. However, the way the ethnic community has been surviving in China is quite contrary to what the recent videos are all about.Soon after the July 5 riots that broke out within Urumqi in 2009 between the Han community and the Uyghurs, China decided to gradually eradicate the very existence of the group, which had already become an ethnic minority in their own land, by bringing into existence a string of policies to downgrade their ease of living, including serious human rights violations such as forced labour and forced sterilisation.Quite identical to what followed after the Tibetan unrest of 2008, detention centres were built on a massive scale for Uyghurs, which were yet again termed \u201cvoluntary re-education camps\u201d. The sole aim of the camp, as referred to by the CCP, is to forestall any extremist behaviour within the ethnic group.Also Read: China may have committed crimes against humanity in Uyghur Muslim territory: UN reportThe things that constitute a hint of possible radical behaviour could include just anything from not shaving your beard to not using a phone for a considerably longer time period; examples of which have already been revealed publicly by an anonymous individual through a leaked database consisting of several photographs of detainees stuck within the detention centres without any sensible reason.In order to turn the masses on one's side, the utmost thing necessary is to control the flow of information and manipulate it that\u2019s basically how a communist regime like that in China thrives. With changing times, individuals and entities across the world have started exploiting the interactive nature of the internet, which is what \u201cparticipatory propaganda\u201d is in simpler terms.As for the Uyghurs, the CCP came up with two different strategies: each for within and outside China. The strategy is to demean Uyghurs within whilst veneering their situation on western platforms so as to baffle the rest of the world and further distort the available data on what\u2019s actually going on in Xinjiang.India Today's Open-Source Investigation (OSINT) team delved into YouTube and found traces of a subtle campaign of bogus accounts professing Uyghurs to be living a \u201chappy\u201d and \u201cunrestrained\u201d life.A series of scripted videos show people belonging to the Uyghur ethnicity claiming that they are leading happy lives and also calling out the United States and western forces to stop slandering the image of Xinjiang.On pasting the title of any of the posted videos in the search bar, we get more such identical accounts with exactly the same headline as posted by the earlier account, which concludes the probable use of an assigned format in disseminating the videos. Interestingly, the hashtags used by the accounts were also the same, namely # and #UyghurHumanRights.On looking closely, nearly all the videos start off and end with the same statement attacking the West.Yet another video that caught our attention was that of a Taiwanese traveler who goes by the username \u201cAbuNowNow\u201d which allegedly shows the Kashgar region of Xinjiang which has been possibly vacated on the orders of the CCP, wherein there is a chart attached inside an abandoned house in both the Chinese and Uyghur languages.The chart titled, 'Main Manifestations of Religious Extremism', has 22 points on what Islam purportedly teaches its followers, including disobeying the CCP. We were able to roughly translate all of the points using Google translate, images of which we are sharing below.We reached out to Campaign for Uyghurs, an organisation advocating for the democratic rights and freedom of the Uyghur people present in Xinjiang and around the world. Arslan Hidayat, the programme manager of the organisation, shared his insight on the subject via email.Q: Do you think that these videos are from genuine residents of Xinjiang? If so, then why do the individuals seem to follow identical scripts with either loud or little to no facial expressions?  A: The residents themselves appear to be from East Turkistan. However, they have been forced to read off a script, hence why the speech is pretty much the same in every video.Q: Has your organisation seen such Uyghur propaganda charts before? What could possibly be the intention behind making such charts and do the mentioned teachings hold the truth in actuality? A: In summary, the chart seems to demonise Islam and its teachings, depicting anyone calling Islam as radical and that the CCP is a true friend of the Uyghurs.Q: What are your views on the funding of the Uyghur Tribunal? Does it really have links to the World Uyghur Congress as claimed in the footage? A: The Uyghur tribunal is an independent tribunal. None of the lawyers was paid and so they could not be influenced. Yes, the money raised did come from Uyghurs, just like in any court case. If you want to take someone, an entity or a government, to court for crimes or an injustice they\u2019ve committed, obviously those who were wronged would take them to court. Beyond that, claims made about the WUC by the Chinese regime are propaganda and disinformation made to try and discredit Uyghurs and our movement for human rights.",

On Sunday, North Korea fired another ballistic missile towards the sea off its east coast.Wednesday's missiles were launched from the Sunan area of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, between 6:10 and 6:20 pm, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said.They flew about 360 km (225 miles), reaching an altitude of 30 km (19 miles) and a maximum velocity of Mach 6 (4,600 mph or 7,450 kmh), they said, adding a detailed analysis was underway.READ | North Korea blames 'alien things' near South Korea border for Covid outbreak\"North Korea's provocations will further strengthen the South Korean-US deterrence and response capability, and only deepen North Korea's isolation from the international community,\" the joint chiefs said in a statement.South Korea's national security council held an emergency meeting and condemned the test, vowing to continue building \"overwhelming\" capacity to deter North Korea, President Yoon Suk-yeol's office said in a separate statement.North Korean state media did not mention the reports of the latest launches, but its leader Kim Jong Un has said its development of nuclear weapons and missiles are meant to defend North Korea against US threats.Japan's coast guard also reported a suspected ballistic missile test, which its minister of state for defence, Toshiro Ino, condemned as \"unacceptable\".

    "content": "The Health Ministry, earlier this week, removed Ranitidine from the list of Essential Medicines joining several countries including the United States in taking action against the salt that has been a cause of concern globally.The salt, which is widely used in medicine like Rantac and Zintac, has been under the scanner for cancer-causing concerns.The Health Ministry on Tuesday released the new National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM), which contains 384 drugs. A total of 26 medicines have been removed from the list, including Ranitidine.While India is the latest to take these medicines off the shelf, the US-based Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) has been investigating Zinetac heartburn medicine after finding a probable cancer-causing impurity in the drug since 2019.Also Read | Rantac, Zinetac removed from essential medicines\u2019 list over cancer concernsRanitidine is a salt, which is widely sold across India under the brand names Aciloc, Zinetac, and Rantac, among others, and is commonly prescribed for acidity and stomachache-related issues.It is prescribed to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastric ulcers, and duodenal ulcers and prevent stress ulcers. The salt, according to the National Library of Medicine (NIH) under the National Centre for Biotechnology Information, inhibits both gastric acid secretion and basal gastric secretion, induced by secretagogues such as histamine and pentagastrin.Ranitidine has been at the center of investigation ever since low levels of carcinogen impurity were detected in the salt. The salt was developed by Glaxo Holdings Ltd, now part of GlaxoSmithKline PLC, and got its first American approval way back in 1983, alongside 31 countries.The over-the-counter (OTC) and the prescription drug was found to have low-level N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), which according to the NIH, is marked as human carcinogens, associated with cancers of the stomach, esophagus, nasopharynx, and bladder. Studies have revealed that a combination of heat and time might be the reason behind the contamination of the salt.Also Read | Ranitidine, White Petrolatum removed from essential medicines list | What it meansThe drug was banned in the US on risk versus benefit ratio and the FDA in a statement in 2020 said, \"Low levels of NDMA are commonly ingested in the diet, for example, NDMA is present in foods and in water. These low levels would not be expected to lead to an increase in the risk of cancer. However, sustained higher levels of exposure may increase the risk of cancer in humans.\"While the Health Ministry took the decision this year, the US had in 2020 sanctioned at least one manufacturing plant in India that makes ingredients used in medications.While cancer-causing concerns from the medicine are global, the US FDA had in its assessment marked that it does not expect nitrosamines to cause harm when ingested at low levels.\"Nitrosamine impurities may increase the risk of cancer if people are exposed to them at above acceptable levels and over long periods of time, but a person taking a drug that contains nitrosamines at, or below, the acceptable daily intake limits every day for 70 years is not expected to have an increased risk of cancer,\" the advisory reads.Also Read | What are the effects of Long Covid?

    "content": "The cancellation of confirmed train tickets would now be costlier as it would attract Goods and Services Tax (GST), according to a circular issued by the Ministry of Finance on August 3. As per the circular issued by the Finance Ministry's Tax Research Unit, booking of tickets is a \u2018contract\u2019, under which the service provider (IRCTC/Indian Railways) promises to provide services to the customer.As per the notification, the cancellation charged for a first class or AC coach ticket would attract 5 per cent GST, which is the rate levied on the ticket. The same logic would be applicable to cancellation of air travel or hotel accommodation, where the cancellation charges would be taxed at the same GST rate as applicable to the principal service.According to the Ministry, the cancellation charge is a payment instead of a breach of contract, so GST has to be paid. Cancellation of a ticket in any such situation would now attract GST at 5 per cent on the cancellation charges.\"When the contract is breached by the passenger, the service provider is compensated with a small amount, collected as a cancellation charge. Since the cancellation charge is a payment, and not breach of contract, it will attract GST,\" the notification read.ALSO READ| After criticism on GST rate hike, Sitharaman says, 'no tax on unpacked food items'For example, cancellation charges of railway tickets for a class would attract GST at the same rate as applicable to the class of travel (i.e. 5% GST on first class or air-conditioned coach ticket and nil for other classes such as second sleeper class). Same is the case for air travel.If one cancels the bookings of a particular class, then the same GST rate applicable for booking seats and berths for that class will be applied. For instance, the rate is 5 per cent for first-class or AC coaches and the cancellation fee for this category is Rs 240, then the total cancellation free will be Rs 252. No GST is applicable on other categories and second sleeper class.Indian Railways charges Rs 240 for cancellation when the ticket is cancelled 48 hours or more before the scheduled departure of the train. If the confirmed ticket is cancelled before 48 hours to 12 hours from the scheduled departure of the train, 25 per cent of the ticket amount is charged as a cancellation fee.",

Rahul and Rohit Sharma (43 off 37) stitched a 96-run opening stand to lay the solid platform for India before Suryakumar, Virat Kohli (49 not out off 28) and Dinesh Karthik (17 not out off 7)capitalized on it to take the side to a daunting total.When Rahul danced down the pitch to hit Aiden Markram over long-on for six and brought up India's hundred in the process, he had reached his fifty in 24 balls. Rahul was caught lbw after failing to sweep Maharaj's skiddy delivery in the following over.With six and two fours off Parnell and a four off Ngidi, Kohli joined the party of boundaries. After hitting a thunderous six over wide long-on to bring the partnership's century within the span of just 41 balls, Suryakumar was run out the very next ball. Before Karthik put the finishing touches on an impressive batting display by India with four and two sixes in the penultimate over, Kohli struck two more fours.It was a tough day for the South African bowlers. There were far too many full tosses too, not sure if it was because of the dew or just poor execution. But South Africa will be very disappointed with their performance. No one apart from Keshav Maharaj showed any kind of discipline.",

    "content": "Brijesh Goyal, the chairman of the Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI) said the trader\u2019s body wrote a letter to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) against the preparations made to levy charges on digital payments.According to the CTI, India has joined the list of most digital payment countries with a major part of the population making payments through Unified Payments Interface (UPI).However, the RBI has now started work on the process of levying charges on the payment and sought public opinion in this regard. Citizens can send in their idea by filling out the form or sending it to the official mail address of RBI by October 3, 2022.ALSO READ | OTT platforms may upend multiplexes' run soon, set to be a Rs 12,000-cr industry by 2023Brijesh Goyal said the CTI believes that there should not be any kind of fee on digital payment as Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself campaigned for the adoption of the online payment mode under 'Digital India'. He said, \u201cPM Modi himself launched the 'BHIM' UPI app. Many companies like Google Pay, Paytm, PhonePe also started offering UPI services. Now people don't have to go to the bank.\u201dGoyal opposed the idea of imposing charges on digital payments and said doing so will affect transactions and people will be forced to stand in line at ATMs and banks again.CTI general secretary Vishnu Bhargava said that traders have also accepted UPI and digital mode and lakhs of transactions take place everyday. He said many traders are worried and levying charges would mean that they have to return to the old cash mode of transactions again.According to the CTI, the discussion paper released by the RBI covers all the fees related to payment systems such as Immediate Payment Service (IMPS), National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT), Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and various payment instruments. The RBI also said that the feedback received in the form of debit cards, credit cards and prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) will be used in formulating policies.The CTI said India has a huge mobile phone user base of around 120 crores. Among them, 75 crore people have smartphones. There are 450 million feature phone users who prefer UPI payments.According to the data by the National Payments Corporation of India, 338 banks are working on the UPI system. About 50 percent of transactions are happening through UPI with an amount less than Rs 200.The CTI has been pleading for two years that the charges on digital transactions should be completely abolished. At present, there is a charge of 1 percent on debit cards and 1 to 2 percent on credit cards.The traders\u2019 body demanded that the government pay the fees to the banks through subsidies. It said the government can reduce the cost of printing currency if it does not levy charges on digital payments and pays the banks fees as subsidies.",

    "content": "The sudden leak in Nord Stream gas pipelines from Russia to Germany has prompted energy-starved Europe to investigate its cause. The pipelines, which is at the heart of the tensions between Russia and Europe amid the Ukraine war, have led to speculations of possible sabotage.On Tuesday, Denmark\u2019s armed forces released a video showing bubbles rushing to the surface of the Baltic Sea above the pipelines. The forces claimed that the gas leak had caused surface disturbances of well over one kilometre in diameter.Swedish authorities have published new footage of a large-scale leak from the Nord Stream gas pipeline, which occurred as a result of sabotageIn Europe,they are already talking about an environmental catastrophe and it is impossible to name the exact timing of the repair work pic.twitter.com/UclYInYlscThe leak comes even as the Nord Stream 1 pipeline has not been operational since August when Russia closed it down for 'maintenance'. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline, though completed, never became operational since the war broke out in Ukraine.The Nord Stream pipelines, owned and operated by Nord Stream AG, directly links Russian gas to Europe via Germany. Russia's state-owned company Gazprom is the largest shareholder in the pipeline.The Nord Stream 1 stream, started in 2011, runs from Vyborg, Russia to the exit point in Lubmin, Germany. The 1,224 km-long Nord Stream 1 consists of two parallel pipelines which provide a maximum of 170 m cubic metres of gas per day from Russia to Germany which then link it to the European grid.Read | US sanctions company building Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipelineNord Stream 2, which runs almost in parallel to Nord Stream 1, was built in September 2021. However, it was never launched even as the pipeline was filled with 300m cubic metres of gas. Later, the project came to a complete standstill after ties between Germany and Russia soured over the latter's invasion of Ukraine.The Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines have a joint annual capacity of 110 billion cubic metres - more than half of Russia's normal gas export volumes.On Monday, Nord Stream AG, the operator of the pipelines, reported a sudden drop in pressure and suggested there could have been a leak.Following this, a Danish Energy Authority issued a statement that a leak had likely occurred in one of the two Nord Stream 2 pipelines lying in Danish waters.A few hours later, Nord Stream AG said it was looking into a drop in pressure in Nord Stream 1.Also Read | How Nord Stream pipeline leak is a threat to climateOn Tuesday, Sweden\u2019s Maritime Administration said two leaks on Nord Stream 1, one in the Swedish economic zone and another in the Danish zone, were northeast of Denmark's Bornholm.The leaks happened just before the ceremonial launch of the Baltic Pipe carrying gas from Norway to Poland on Tuesday. The pipeline is an effort by Poland to decrease its dependence on Russia for energy.So far, there is no reason why the leak happened. However, European nations see it as the next step of Russia's aggression in Ukraine.\"We see clearly that it's an act of sabotage, related to the next step of escalation of the situation in Ukraine,\" Reuters quoted Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki as saying.Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said it was too early to say anything conclusive on the leaks but stressed that multiple leaks could not be just a coincidence.Meanwhile, Ukraine directly accused Russia of the gas leak, calling it a \"terrorist attack\". Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak said the damage to Nord Stream 1 and 2 was the Kremlin's \"act of aggression\" towards the European Union.\"Gas leak from NS-1 [Nord Stream 1] is nothing more than a terrorist attack planned by Russia and an act of aggression towards the EU. Russia wants to destabilise the economic situation in Europe and cause pre-winter panic,\" Podolyak said in a tweet.Also Read | Leaks on Russian gas pipelines raise concerns about sabotageRussia, on the other hand, also did not deny speculations over sabotage. \"No option can be ruled out right now,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said when asked about sabotage rumours.\"This is a very concerning news. Indeed, we are talking about some damage of an unclear nature to the pipeline in Denmark's economic zone...This is an issue related to the energy security of the entire continent,\" Reuters quoted Peskov as saying.Russia had already decreased the supply of gas to Europe after the European Union imposed sanctions on Moscow for invading Ukraine. Flows via Nord Stream 2 were reduced to 20 per cent of its capacity in July.In August end, Russia further plugged the supply and stopped Nord Stream 1 completely, citing maintenance. Gazprom had reasoned that an oil leak in a turbine on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline was behind the closure.The Nord Stream 2, despite being completed, could not become operational after Germany pulled out of the project after Russia invaded Ukraine. The stream was supposed to double Russia's energy export to Europe to 110 billion cubic meters.The short supply of the gas pipeline resulted in a sudden hike in energy prices in Europe. With the shutting down of Nord Stream pipeline, Europe faces a tough time ahead with winter approaching.",

The details were released by the UK Health Security Agency in its summary of variants under investigation in England.The organisation detailed that it has a mutation in a known antigenically significant site and an apparent small growth advantage relative to BA.5. The document noted that 3.1% of the samples during the week of August 14 had the new subversion.READ | What are the effects of Long Covid? Expert answersMeanwhile, the US-based Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has also said that BA.4.6 now accounts for more than 9% of recent cases across the US.A descendent of BA.4, the BA.4.6 is yet to be completely diagnosed and researchers are yet to understand the source of the new likely subvariant.According to a report in The Conversation, initial analysis revealed that BA4.6 carries a mutation to the spike protein, a protein on the surface of the virus which allows it to enter our cells. The report noted that the mutation, R346T, has been seen in other variants and is associated with immune evasion, meaning it helps the virus to escape antibodies acquired from vaccination and prior infection.A study published in preprint indicates that the new subvariant will be less deadly the same as the Omicron, but could be equally good at evading immune systems.ALSO READ | When life began and then suddenly ended in Earth's oceansSo far, no cases of the new subvariant have been reported in India.India logged 5,108 new coronavirus infections taking the total tally of COVID-19 cases to 4,45,10,057, while the active cases dipped to 45,749, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Wednesday.The death count climbed to 52,82,16 with 19 fatalities, which includes 12 deaths reconciled by Kerala, the data updated at 8 am stated.",

    "content": "A decade-long legal battle finally ended on Sunday with the demolition of the Supertech Twin Towers in Noida\u2019s Sector 93A. The 100-metre-tall structures were brought down nearly a year after the Supreme Court found them in violation of building norms and ordered them to be razed.The fall of these iconic towers has sent a strong message to builders and officials colluding in corruption. But the razing of the Twin Towers has also posed some tough questions to Supertech Group. How will the demolition of the Twin Towers affect the financial position of Supertech Group? And will the company be able to complete its remaining unfinished projects?India Today spoke to Supertech Group Chairman RK Arora to get answers to the above questions.Supertech Group chairman RK Arora has expressed confidence that the demolition of the Twin Towers will not affect other projects.Even before the Twin Towers were reduced to rubble, the company had issued a statement saying that it has delivered more than 70,000 flats and the demolition of these two towers with 952 flats will not affect the rest of the company's projects.ALSO READ | On demolition day, Supertech boss defends Twin Towers, says buildings constructed legallyNotably, Twin Towers held only about 1 per cent of the total under-construction and delivered flats of the company.According to RK Arora, the company has already made 70,000 flats and about 20,000 flats are under construction.In total, the firm has been involved in the construction of 90,000 flats, of which the Twin Towers\u2019 952 flats make up just 1 per cent.RK Arora pointed out that the Supertech Group is valued at over Rs 10,000 crore. However, the firm had to suffer a loss of 500 crore due to the Twin Towers, including construction and refund, which would make it 5 per cent of the total valuation.ALSO READ | Noida Twin Towers demolished, what next?This amount cannot be considered a small amount, nor can a loss of 5 per cent be considered a minor loss.According to RK Arora, the Supertech Group is facing a cash crunch. In such a situation, to complete the remaining 20,000 apartments, which have been built up to 60 to 80 per cent, the firm is trying to arrange funding.Presently, as the real estate market faces troubles of its own, the Supertech Group is finding it difficult to arrange funding, RK Arora said. He, however, assured that the construction of the remaining apartments would be finished in the next two years.Supertech Group chairman RK Arora claims that only one project of Supertech Group has gone into the insolvency process. This project is Ecovillage-2, located in Greater Noida West i.e. Noida Extension.ALSO READ | Watch the Noida Twin Towers demolition through the eyes of a droneAccording to Arora, except for 3009 flats of this project, no other project of the company is in disputed condition.He said the firm is trying to arrange for last-mile funding to finish other projects soon.During the inauguration of the two towers of Supernova in 2018, the Supertech Group\u2019s Managing Director, Mohit Arora, had said that only 2 per cent of the firm\u2019s flats are in dispute. The remaining 98 per cent part is clear and there is no dispute on that, he said.The Twin towers were also included in this 2 per cent at that time. The company said that 3009 flats in Eco Village-2 had come under insolvency.In total, 4000 flats of Supertech Group- 952 flats of the now demolished Twin Towers and 3009 flats of Eco Village- are disputed. This means that 4.5 per cent of the company\u2019s total flats fall under the disputed category.However, the homebuyers of Twin Towers flats have been given refunds. And so, excluding the Twin Towers, only 3 per cent of the Supertech Group\u2019s projects are disputed.ALSO READ | Ran right inside: Demolition expert, covered in soot, recalls moment Twin Towers fellBut, from 2018 to 2022, the company\u2019s disputed project has seen a rise of 1 per cent.

The more than four-decade-old program suffered deep cuts under the Trump administration, which slashed admissions to a record low of 15,000.After taking office, Biden quadrupled the number of refugee admissions permitted for the remaining months of the 2021 budget year. He then set the target at 125,000 for the 2022 budget year, which ends Sept. 30.

    "content": "Nearly three years after the Covid-19 pandemic began, the effects of the deadly infection are expected too linger for a long period of time.According to the data released by the World Health Organisation (WHO), at least 17 million people in the European region have experienced symptoms of Long Covid in the last two years.WHAT IS LONG COVID?WHO has defined Long Covid as a condition that occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, usually three months from the start of Covid-19.Experts say that Covid-19 symptoms persisting beyond 4-6 weeks after recovery is called Long Covid. \u201cIt persists and consists of so many constellations of symptoms that are basic, subjective and sometimes, vague,\u201d says Dr Neha Rastogi Panda, Consultant Infectious Diseases, Fortis Hospital, Gurugram.She adds that most people think that fatigue could be a part of recovery, but it might be a symptom of Long Covid, which can be diagnosed by a medical expert. \u201cMore than 200 plus symptoms have been recorded when we researched Long Covid that can range from weakness, variations in hunger, continuous acidity to prolonged nausea, stomach bloating, indigestion, constipation or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), memory effect,\u201d says Dr Panda.Another symptom of Long Covid is the altering frequency of the urination, which sometimes is termed UTI (urinary tract infection), but many times, this condition is a self-manifestation of Covid-19.\u201cIf people had problems with breathing during their Covid-19 diagnosis or required oxygen, they might have difficulty breathing or might cough continuously, which is another sign for Long Covid,\u201d says Dr Panda.\"One of the most important effects of Covid-19 that one should be aware of is the psychiatric problem. One can experience a decline in memory power, especially in connection with Covid-19. They can also have some behavioural issues. Mood swings may be observed too. These are, in fact, silent symptoms of Long Covid,\u201d she says.WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF LONG COVID?- Chest-related symptoms: If breathing or cough continues, it can affect one's working and breathing capacity.- Continuous weakness and fatigue: This can cause anxiety and stress and affect one\u2019s overall daily living.- Gastric effects: Feelings of acidity, vomiting, indigestion and bloating in daily life can be troubling to not just the sufferer but their family members too.Since more cases of Long Covid are being reported globally, Dr Panda says around four crore people in India are suffering from at least one of the symptoms of Long Covid. \u201cIn my personal experience, I have seen more than 75 plus patients who have been, in some way or other, in the last three months, complaining gastric problems, persisting weakness and fatigue, sleep disturbances and dry cough that almost sounds like that of an asthmatic person,\u201d she says.According to Dr. Soumyadeep Chakraborty, Associate Consultant, Critical Care Medicine, Amri Hospital, there is a wide range of complications for those who have been diagnosed with Covid-19. \"There is a huge range of complications of the 1st and 2nd wave of covid starting with hair fall to silent cardiac arrests. It does not depend on severe or mild cases of Covid-19. Instead, long Covid can affect anyone who has had any degree of the disease. To some extent, it was observed that vaccinated people have less chances of developing severe complications of post Covid,\" he says.Since Long Covid is an \u201cemerging entity\u201d that is important for awareness, one shouldn\u2019t take it lightly. \u201cAnything could be a hidden symptom of Long Covid. One should follow up with a medical expert,\u201d says Dr Panda.",

    "content": "The OTT market is set to do an encore of what multiplexes did to the VCR/VCP/VCD segment in the early 2000s and is set to become a Rs 12,000-crore industry by 2023, up from Rs 2,590 crore in 2018, says a report.According to SBI Research, the over-the-top or OTT market is expected to reach Rs 11,944 crore by 2023, up from Rs 2,590 crore in 2018, logging in a compound annual growth of 36 per cent.This may lead to a repeat of the sudden death of the VCR/VCP/DVD industry that boomed in the 1980s, with the exponential rise of multiplexes since early 2000s across metro/urban areas, the report warns.READ | Sonali Phogat\u2019s drink spiked with MDMA: Goa Police\u2019s big revealOTT has already chipped away 7-9 per cent of the entertainment industry share and revenue, and is consistently growing with over 40-odd players and offering original media content in all languages.Quoting various industry reports, Soumya Kanti Ghosh, the group chief economic adviser, said there are over 45 crore OTT subscribers today in the country and this is expected to reach 50 crore by end-2023.ALSO READ | Serial killer on prowl: Arvind Kejriwal jabs BJP, seeks trust vote in assembly on MondayThis strong growth is led by affordable high-speed mobile Internet, doubling of Internet users, increased adoption of digital payments and discounted price offered by global players such as Disney+Hotstar (14 crore subscribers), Amazon Prime Video (6 crore subscribers), Netflix (4 crore), Zee5 (3.7 crore) and Sonyliv (2.5 crore) offering plans at 70-90 percent cheaper than the US.The OTT space is also seeing number of local and regional players with players like Sonyliv Voot, Zee5, AltBalaji, Hoichoi etc catering to regional demand.The rise of OTT is expected to eat into cinemas' profits as over 50 per cent of the people use OTTs more than 5 hrs a month. What's more, major studios have realized creating streaming series and movies is far more profitable than traditional filmmaking, especially if they build their own streaming platforms.He also warns that options such as Smart TV and Chromecast coming into the picture have impacted the traditional mode of entertainment the most.It can be noted that the 1980s saw the exponential rise in video cassette recorders/players (VCRs/VCPs) that for the first time challenged the established modes and models of viewing a movie.But the rise of multiplexes in the early 2000s across the metros and large cities effectively killed the DVD industry and single screens. And the onslaught of OTT platforms is set to do to multiplexes what they had done to DVD markets in the early 2000s.And the biggest boost to disruption was the Covid-led lockdowns which completely shut cinemas--something even the two world wars couldn't do.ALSO READ | 3 out of 5 monkeypox cases in Delhi show history of heterosexual contact, 2 show no sexual historyThis had Hollywood heavyweights such as James Cameron and Martin Scorsese describing the shutdowns an existential threat to cinemas, and calling for government assistance to help the industry survive. But technology did more help than the government doles and that is OTTs.Around 30 Hindi films had a digital premiere during the pandemic. However, now regional web series and films are focused more even by global players.The OTT segment is still led by free (ad-supported) offerings which had 18.4 crore subscribers in 2017 and the same is set nearly double to 35.1 crore this year and scale to 46.6 crore by 2027.The pay-per-view segment stood at 3.5 crore in 2018 and is on course to touch 8.9 crore this year and touch 11.7 crore in 2027. Video downloads were 4.2 crore and 7.7 crore 8.6 crore, while video streaming at 1.9 crore, 6.8 crore, and 10.8 crore, respectively during this period.Going forward, it is expected that OTT platforms' expansion into education, health, and fitness will additionally cement its future. It has unlocked new routes for content creators, and the audience has begun to understand it as more than just a medium of enjoyment.",

    "content": "Residents of Florida's Gulf Coast on Tuesday boarded up homes, packed up their vehicles and headed for higher ground as Hurricane Ian drew near, threatening to bring a deadly storm surge and more than a foot of rain to some areas.Ian churned across the southeastern edge of the Gulf of Mexico headed for Florida after slamming into Cuba earlier in the day, leaving the entire country without power, forcing mass evacuations and swamping fishing villages.ALSO READ | Hurricane Ian strikes Cuba, Florida braces for category 4 damageMore than 2.5 million Floridians were under evacuation orders or warnings with the sprawling storm on track to make landfall as a Category 3 or Category 4 hurricane on Wednesday evening somewhere along Florida's Gulf Coast.A Category 3 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale carries maximum sustained winds of up to 129 miles per hour (208 km per hour). The latest 8 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT) hurricane advisory put Ian's top winds at 120 mph (195 km per hour).Ian was most likely to come ashore south of Tampa near Sarasota, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. That region - home to miles of sandy beaches, scores of resort hotels and numerous mobile home parks - is a favorite with retirees and vacationers alike.ALSO READ | Something we have never seen before: Florida braces for Hurricane Ian's impact\"I know I should be scared of this one, but I'm too busy to be scared. I just know we have to go,\" said John O'Leary, a jazz pianist from Tampa, said as he and his wife loaded food, water and family photos into their car before heading to his mother's house in Palm Harbor, 25 miles (40 km) to the west.O'Leary, 36, was one of the thousands of motorists to hit the road as they fled low-lying areas in hopes of avoiding a potentially life-threatening storm surge that, according to forecasters, could reach 12 feet (3.7 meters) in the Sarasota area.While predictions remained imprecise for where the storm would come ashore, \"the impacts are going to be far, far broader than just where the eye of the storm happens to make landfall,\" Governor Ron DeSantis said.DeSantis warned of the potential for devastating Hurricane Harvey-like flooding that struck the Houston area in 2017, the result of a slow-moving storm piling up high water.ALSO READ | Hurricane Fiona pounds Bermuda as Canada braces for major joltParts of central Florida could see as much of 2 feet (0.6 meter) of rain from Ian, according to the National Weather Service. The NHC also issued extensive storm surge warnings for about half of western Florida's shoreline, with predictions of life-threatening coastal flooding up to 12 feet from wind-driven high surf.Florida's director of emergency management, Kevin Guthrie, urged residents in evacuation zones to move to safety.\"The time to evacuate is now. Get on the road,\" he said.To ease traffic congestion, authorities suspended toll collections along major highways in central Florida, the Tampa Bay area and the interstate stretch across the Everglades known as Alligator Alley.Some residents, such as Vanessa Vazquez, 50, a software engineer in St. Petersburg, said they planned to ride out the storm at home despite evacuation warnings.\"I'm staying put,\" Vazquez said. \"I have four cats and I don't want to stress them out. And we have a strong house.\"If Ian strikes Tampa, it would be the first hurricane to make landfall in the area since the Tarpon Springs storm in 1921.It also may prove one of the costliest as the latest simulations projected storm-related damages ranging from $38 billion to more than $60 billion, Enki Research said on Tuesday.Nearly 60 Florida school districts were either closed Tuesday or planned to be closed by Wednesday, DeSantis said. Many of those schools were designated as shelters for the storm and its aftermath.Commercial airlines canceled more than 2,000 US flights due to the storm.The St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport - located on a vulnerable peninsula east of Tampa Bay - ceased operations at midday, and the Tampa International Airport shut down a few hours later.Tampa Electric warned customers to be prepared for \"extended outages.\" The company will institute a \"targeted interruption\" of service to a part of downtown Tampa on the western edge of the city. That area has already been evacuated.ALSO READ | Wild horses face unruly storms as Fiona nears Canada's east coastDeSantis said nearly 100 evacuation shelters had opened statewide.\u201cThis is a mobile home community, and they really need this shelter,\u201d said Fabiola Galvan Leon, a preschool teacher acting as a bilingual translator for hundreds of evacuees flocking to Reddick Elementary in Wimauma, Florida, southeast of Tampa, to ride out the storm.The shelves at a nearby Walmart store had been stripped almost bare, though a contingent of shoppers wandered the aisles, hurriedly grabbing the last remaining boxes of water, canned goods and loaves of bread.The Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) announced it was closing its Florida theme and water parks on Wednesday and Thursday while the National Football League's Tampa Bay Buccaneers relocated to Miami, where they will practice this week ahead of their game against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.ALSO READ | Nasa to move Artemis-1 moon rocket to safety, launch unlikely in Oct",

They have used spherical vesicles secreted by bacteria coated on gold nanoparticles which can then be delivered to immune cells.They are hopeful that the new vaccine can trigger an immune response and offer protection against the disease. So far, India has been using the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine to fight TB. It contains a weakened form of the disease-causing bacterium, and when injected into our bloodstream, it triggers the production of antibodies that can help fight the disease.The new vaccine candidate has been developed by a group of researchers led by Rachit Agarwal, Assistant Professor at the Centre for BioSystems Science and Engineering (BSSE). The subunit vaccine candidate contains only parts of the infectious bacterium to stimulate an immune response.Also Read | Ranitidine, White Petrolatum removed from essential medicines list | What it meansThe findings of their research have been published in Biomaterials Advances. \u201cThey\u2019re safer compared to a live bacterium, and since they are membrane-derived, they contain all kinds of antigens,\u201d explains Agarwal, the senior author of the paper.The team used Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs), which are spherical membrane-bound particles released by some bacteria, and contain an assortment of proteins and lipids which could induce an immune response against the pathogen.IISc in a statement said that while subunit vaccines typically only contain a limited number of antigens bacterial proteins that can elicit an immune response in the host, OMVs contain a variety of antigens and can induce a better immune response, according to the researchers.Also Read | New blood test detects multiple cancers without symptomsWhile Mycobacterium-derived OMVs are unstable, researchers claim that OMVs coated on gold nanoparticles were found to be uniform in size and stable and that \"human immune cells showed a higher uptake of OMV-AuNPs than of OMVs or gold nanoparticles alone.\"Researchers forced the OMVs and the gold nanoparticles together to synthesize OMV-AuNPsthrough a 100 nm filter. They then treated immune cells that were cultured in the lab with OMVs derived from Mycobacterium smegmatis, a related bacterial species that does not cause disease in humans.The team now plans to develop gold-coated OMVs derived directly from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and test them on animal models to take the results forward for clinical applications.Also Read | Rantac, Zinetac removed from essential medicines\u2019 list over cancer concerns",

According to Russia-installed election officials, 93 per cent of the ballots cast in the Zaporizhzhia region supported annexation, as did 87 per cent in the Kherson region, 98 per cent in the Luhansk region and 99% in Donetsk.Possibly explaining the lower favourable vote in Kherson is that Russian authorities there have faced a strong Ukrainian underground resistance movement whose members have killed Moscow-appointed officials and threatened those who considered voting.ALSO READ | Ukraine and Russia: What you need to know right nowIn a remark that appeared to rule out negotiations, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the UN Security Council by video from Kyiv that Russia\u2019s attempts to annex Ukrainian territory will mean \u201cthere is nothing to talk about with this president of Russia.\u201dHe added that \u201cany annexation in the modern world is a crime, a crime against all states that consider the inviolability of border to be vital for themselves.\u201dThe preordained outcome sets the stage for a dangerous new phase in Russia\u2019s seven-month war, with the Kremlin threatening to throw more troops into the battle and potentially use nuclear weapons.The referendums asking residents whether they wanted the four occupied southern and eastern Ukraine regions to be incorporated into Russia began Sept. 23, often with armed officials going door-to-door collecting votes.Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to address Russia\u2019s parliament about the referendums on Friday, and Valentina Matviyenko, who chairs the body\u2019s upper house, said lawmakers could consider annexation legislation on Oct. 4.ALSO READ | 'Putin cornered, might go nuclear': Ex-CIA official on Russia-Ukraine warMeanwhile, Russia ramped up warnings that it could deploy nuclear weapons to defend its territory, including newly acquired land, and continued mobilizing more than a quarter-million additional troops to deploy to a front line of more than 1,000 kms (more than 620 miles).After the balloting, \u201cthe situation will radically change from the legal viewpoint, from the point of view of international law, with all the corresponding consequences for protection of those areas and ensuring their security,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday.Many Western leaders have called the referendum a sham, and the UN Security Council met Tuesday in New York to discuss the voting, with the US and Albania planning to introduce a resolution that says the results will never be accepted and that the four regions remain part of Ukraine. Russia is certain to veto the resolution.The balloting and a call-up of Russian military reservists that Putin ordered last Wednesday are aimed at buttressing Moscow\u2019s exposed military and political positions.The referendums follow a familiar Kremlin playbook for territorial expansion and more aggressive military action. In 2014, Russian authorities held a similar referendum on Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula, under the close watch of Russian troops. Based on the voting, Russia annexed Crimea. Putin cited the defence of Russians living in Ukraine\u2019s eastern regions, their supposed desires to join with Russia, and an existential security threat to Russia as a pretext for his Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.Putin has been talking up Moscow\u2019s nuclear option since Ukrainians launched a counteroffensive that reclaimed territory and has increasingly cornered his forces. A top Putin aide ratcheted up the nuclear rhetoric Tuesday.ALSO READ | Russians paying a bomb to get on private planes to flee after war mobilisation\u201cLet\u2019s imagine that Russia is forced to use the most powerful weapon against the Ukrainian regime that has committed a large-scale act of aggression, which is dangerous for the very existence of our state,\u201d Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of the Russian Security Council that Putin chairs, wrote on his messaging app channel. \u201cI believe that NATO will steer clear from direct meddling in the conflict.\u201dThe United States has dismissed the Kremlin\u2019s nuclear talk as a scare tactic.The referendums asked residents whether they want the areas to be incorporated into Russia, and the Kremlin has portrayed them as free and fair, reflective of the people\u2019s desire for self-determination.Tens of thousands of residents had already fled the regions because of the war, and images shared by those who remained showed armed Russian troops going door-to-door to pressure Ukrainians into voting.Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko, who left the port city after the Russians seized it after a months-long siege, said only about 20% of the 100,000 estimated remaining residents cast ballots in the Donetsk referendum. Mariupol\u2019s pre-war population was 541,000.\u201cA man toting an assault rifle comes to your home and asks you to vote, so what can people do?\u201d Boychenko asked during a news conference, explaining how people were coerced into voting.Western allies sided firmly with Ukraine, dismissing the referendum votes as a meaningless sham.British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said the ballots were \u201ca desperate move\u201d by Putin. French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said while visiting Kyiv on Tuesday that France was determined \u201cto support Ukraine and its sovereignty and territorial integrity\u201d and described the ballots as \u201cmock referendums.\u201dALSO READ | Russia admits to making mistake after old, sick people mobilised for Ukraine warElsewhere, trouble emerged for Putin in the mass call-up he ordered of Russians to active military duty.The order has triggered an exodus of nearly 200,000 men from Russia, fueled anti-war protests and sparked violence. On Monday, a gunman opened fire in an enlistment office in a Siberian city and gravely wounded the local chief military recruitment officer. Scattered arson attacks had been reported earlier on other enlistment offices.One destination of fleeing Russian men is Kazakhstan, which reported Tuesday that about 98,000 Russians have crossed into Kazakhstan over the past week.The European Union\u2019s border and coast guard agency says 66,000 Russian citizens entered the 27-nation bloc from Sept. 19 to 25, a 30% increase over the preceding week.Russian officials tried to intercept some of the fleeing reservists on one of the main exodus routes, issuing conscription notices on the Georgian border. According to the state-run Tass agency, an enlistment task force was handing out notices at the Verkhnii Lars checkpoint, where an estimated 5,500 cars were lining up to cross. Independent Russian news sources have reported unconfirmed claims that draft-age men will be banned from leaving after the referendum.As Moscow worked to build up its troops in Ukraine, potentially sending them to supplement its proxies who have been fighting in the separatist regions for the past eight years, Russian shelling continued to claim lives. Russian barrages killed at least 11 civilians and wounded 18 in 24 hours, Ukraine\u2019s presidential office said Tuesday.In other developments, Ukrainian authorities reported more success in their counteroffensive to reclaim territory in some of the very regions where Russia is staging the referendums to consolidate its grip.Ukrainian troops claimed to continue their push beyond the Oskil River in the country\u2019s east, pressing further into the Donbas. A video on social media Tuesday showed Ukrainian soldiers entering the village of Koroviy Yar, 15 kilometers (about 9 miles) from the river. Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence said that the country\u2019s forces continued to force Russian troops out of the northeastern Kharkiv region and claimed to recapture the major railway junction of Kupyansk-Vuzlovyi.The war\u2019s human toll was also reflected in a UN human rights monitoring mission\u2019s first comprehensive look at violations and abuses Russia and Ukraine committed between Feb. 1 and July 31, the first five months of Russia\u2019s invasion.ALSO READ | \u2018Won\u2019t let Putin turn me into a killer\u2019: Russians flee across border after news of draftMatilda Bogner, the mission\u2019s chief, said Ukrainian prisoners of war appeared to have faced \u201csystematic\u201d mistreatment, \u201cnot only upon their capture, but also following their transfer to places of internment\u201d in Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine and Russia itself.The war has brought an energy crunch for much of Western Europe, with German officials seeing the disruption of Russian supplies as a Kremlin power play to pressure Europe over its support for Ukraine.The danger to energy supplies grew when seismologists reported Tuesday that explosions rattled the Baltic Sea before unusual leaks were discovered on two underwater natural gas pipelines running from Russia to Germany. Some European leaders and experts pointed to possible sabotage during an energy standoff with Russia provoked by the war in Ukraine. The three leaks were reported on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, which are filled with natural gas but not delivering the fuel to Europe.The damage means that the pipelines are unlikely to be able to carry any gas to Europe this winter even if the political will to bring them online emerged, analysts at the Eurasia Group said.ALSO READ | 'War has come to our homes': Flights sold-out as Putin orders partial military call-up",

    "content": "We know more about the Moon than we know about the oceans on Earth, and as more research pours out of the depths, new findings are being unravelled. A new study reveals how oxygen boosted life in the waters of Earth's oceans and then suddenly disappeared.Researchers have looked at the continental movement to understand the circulation of life-supporting oxygen in the oceans and how it could have the opposite effect, killing most deep ocean creatures. The study revealed that the circulation of oxygen and nutrients can end quite suddenly.The findings of the study published in the journal Nature state that the early evolutionary and much of the extinction history of marine animals is thought to be driven by changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations in the ocean and is widely assumed to be dominated by the geological history of atmospheric oxygen.Also Read | Climate impacts heading to uncharted territories of destruction, says UN chief\u201cContinental drift seems so slow, like nothing drastic could come from it, but when the ocean is primed, even a seemingly tiny event could trigger the widespread death of marine life,\" Andy Ridgwell, UC Riverside geologist and co-author of the study released said in a statement.While life flourishes across oceans, in frigid world of the poles, it is triggered when oxygen pulled from Earth\u2019s atmosphere reaches down to the ocean floor. The oxygen is transported to the bottom as it sinks as water becomes colder and denser at the poles. A return flow then brings the organic matter back to the ocean\u2019s surface, which leads to the growth of plankton.Researchers developed complex computer models to investigate whether the locations of continental plates affect how the ocean moves oxygen around. They found that the global ocean circulation seemed to periodically shut down. They call it ocean anoxia \u2014 times when oceanic oxygen disappeared.Also Read | Earth could be even friendlier to life if Jupiter...\u201cMany millions of years ago, not so long after animal life in the ocean got started, the entire global ocean circulation seemed to periodically shut down. We were not expecting to find that the movement of continents could cause surface waters and oxygen to stop sinking, and possibly dramatically affect the way life evolved on Earth,\u201d Ridgwell added.The study revealed that collapse in global water circulation led to a stark separation between oxygen levels in the upper and lower depths. This loss spanned through the entire seafloor, except, places close to the coast, and the shutdown remained in place until 440 million years ago.CAN IT HAPPEN AGAIN?While researchers are still looking to understand if it could happen, they are trying to find out when can it happen. They said that while it is difficult to identify when a collapse might occur, or what triggers it, \" existing climate models confirm that increasing global warming will weaken ocean circulation.\"\u201cWe\u2019d need a higher resolution climate model to predict a mass extinction event. That said, we do already have concerns about water circulation in the North Atlantic today, and there is evidence that the flow of water to depth is declining,\u201d Ridgwell said adding that d an unusually warm summer or the erosion of a cliff could trigger a cascade of processes that upends life as it appears today.Also Read | Warning bells of extreme climate events we face today rang a decade ago",

    "content": "Life and consciousness in the solar system are rare, so much so that it's only found on Earth and no matter where we have looked, the world beyond Earth remains inhabitable, inhospitable, and completely devoid of any signs of life. New research indicates that Earth could be even more hospitable for life if there was a change in Jupiter's orbit.Scientists at the University of California-Riverside have created an alternative Solar System in which the orbits of the plants were changed including that of Earth. Scientists exploited the idea of eccentric orbits, where the orbit is oval-shaped and when the planet gets closer to its star, it receives more heat, affecting the climate.The study published in The Astronomical Journal states that in the search for life beyond our solar system, attention should be focused on those planets that have the potential to maintain habitable conditions over the prolonged periods of time needed for the emergence and expansion of life as we know it.Researchers found that if the gigantic Jupiter\u2019s orbit were to become more eccentric, it would lead to major changes in the shape of Earth's orbit and bring it closer to the Sun in its own orbit. This would mean that parts of the Earth\u2019s surface that are now sub-freezing would get warmer, increasing temperatures in the habitable range.Also Read | Warning bells of extreme climate events we face today rang a decade ago\u201cIf Jupiter\u2019s position remained the same, but the shape of its orbit changed, it could actually increase this planet\u2019s habitability,\u201d Pam Vervoort, UCR Earth and planetary scientist and lead study author, said in a statement.The changing orbit would also mean changes in the seasons, where parts of the planet may be pleasant during one season, and extremely hot or cold in another.

    "content": "A prehistoric human skeleton has been found in a cave system that was flooded at the end of the last ice age 8,000 years ago, according to a cave-diving archaeologist on Mexico\u2019s Caribbean coast.Archaeologist Octavio del Rio said he and fellow diver Peter Broger saw the shattered skull and skeleton partly covered by sediment in a cave near where the Mexican government plans to build a high-speed tourist train through the jungle.Given the distance from the cave entrance, the skeleton couldn\u2019t have gotten there without modern diving equipment, so it must be over 8,000 years old, Del Rio said, referring to the era when rising sea levels flooded the caves.\u201cThere it is. We don\u2019t know if the body was deposited there or if that was where this person died,\u201d said Del Rio. He said that the skeleton was located about 8 meters (26 feet) underwater, about a half-kilometer (one third of a mile) into the cave system.Some of the oldest human remains in North America have been discovered in the sinkhole caves known as \u201ccenotes\u201d on the country\u2019s Caribbean coast, and experts say some of those caves are threatened by the Mexican government\u2019s Maya Train tourism project.Del Rio, who has worked with the National Institute of Anthropology and History on projects in the past, said he had notified the institute of the discovery. The institute did not immediately respond to questions about whether it intended to explore the site.But Del Rio said Tuesday that institute archaeologist Carmen Rojas told him that the site was registered and would be investigated by the institute\u2019s Quintana Roo state branch Holocene Archaeology Project.He stressed that the cave \u2014 whose location he did not reveal because of a fear the site could be looted or disturbed \u2014 was near where the government has cut down a swath of jungle to lay train tracks, and could be collapsed, contaminated or closed off by the building project and subsequent development.\u201cThere is a lot more study that has to be done in order to correctly interpret\u201d the find, Del Rio said, noting that \u201cdating, some kind of photographic studies and some collection\u201d would be needed to determine exactly how old the skeleton is.Del Rio has been exploring the region for three decades, and in 2002, he participated in the discovery and cataloguing of remains known as The Woman of Naharon, who died around the same time, or perhaps earlier, than Naia \u2014 the nearly complete skeleton of a young woman who died around 13,000 years ago. It was discovered in a nearby cave system in 2007.President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador is racing to finish his Maya Train project in the remaining two years of his term over the objections of environmentalists, cave divers and archaeologists. They say his haste will allow little time to study the ancient remains.Activists say the heavy, high-speed rail project will fragment the coastal jungle and will run often above the fragile limestone caves, which \u2014 because they\u2019re flooded, twisty and often incredibly narrow \u2014 can take decades to explore.Caves along part of the coast already have been damaged by construction above them, with cement pilings used to support the weight above.The 950-mile (1,500-kilometer) Maya Train line is meant to run in a rough loop around the Yucatan Peninsula, connecting beach resorts and archaeological sites.The most controversial stretch cuts a more than 68-mile (110-kilometer) swath through the jungle between the resorts of Cancun and Tulum.Del Rio said the route through the jungle should be abandoned and the train should be built over the already-impacted coastal highway between Cancun and Tulum, as was originally planned.L\u00f3pez Obrador abandoned the highway route after hotel owners voiced objections, and cost and traffic interruptions became a concern.\u201cWhat we want is for them to change to route at this spot, because of the archaeological finds that have been made there, and their importance,\u201d said Del Rio. \u201cThey should take the train away from there and put it where they said they were going to build before, on the highway ... an area that has already been affected, devastated.\u201d",

The pandemic eroded nearly Rs. 17.4 lakh crore from India\u2019s real GDP, and salary cuts and unemployment hit affordable housing sales. That, however, was not the case with luxury homebuyers.\u201cOf nearly 1.84 lakh units sold in the top seven cities in H1 2022, about 14 per cent were in luxury homes. On the contrary, of 2.61 lakh units sold in the whole of 2019, only seven per cent were in the luxury category,\u201d an Anarock Group report noted.ALSO READ: | Why Covid cases are sharply rising in IndiaOn the other hand, the affordable housing segment (units priced under Rs. 40 lakh) saw its sales share dip from 38 per cent in 2019 to 31 per cent in H1 2022. Post-pandemic, affordable housing was significantly impacted because its target audience took the biggest economic hit.\u201cEven though the typical buyers in the luxury segment were not as impacted by the pandemic as the rest, HNI (High Net Income) buyers are conscious of cost. Discounts by developers have made luxury properties very attractive for these buyers, while NRIs have also been snapping up luxury homes in India because of the favourable exchange rate,\u201d said Anuj Puri, the Chairman of Anarock Group.Even before the pandemic began, the real estate sector was facing headwinds from three directions \u2014 demonetisation, GST, and RERA. The growth rate of the house price index, too, has been on a downward trajectory since 2016.Despite the sectoral slowdown, however, the luxury house market is on a roll.\u201cThe disposable income earned in equity-bond markets in juxtaposition with deep savings on consumption outlays during the pandemic season is the primary reason for the spike in housing demand,\u201d Dr Niranjan Hiranandani, MD, Hiranandani Group, told India Today.This has garnered a huge inclination from HNI buyers to park their accumulated earnings in the luxury property market for long-term gains, he added. NRIs have realised the significance of owning a safe nest back home amidst currency depreciation and geopolitical havoc, he further said.ALSO READ: | Covid cases down, how Indians are resurrecting their dating livesThe Care Ratings report published in April 2021 highlighted that the \u201cWork From Home\u201d or blended work from the home situation has led to homebuyers buying their own space or a bigger space.Cheap home loans, lucrative payment plans, and attractive prices coupled with favourable government reforms have together supported home-buying activity, especially in places where buyers are able to avail of taxation benefits.",

The viral outbreak has so far killed over 57,000 cattle across India.Punjab is the second state after Himachal to ask the Centre to take action on the deadly infection. The Himachal Pradesh government had urged the Centre to declare Lumpy Skin Disease an epidemic.So, what is this deadly infection, which has governments from Jharkhand to Gujarat to Maharashtra on edge?Also Read | Lumpy virus kills 236 cattle in UP, affects 25 districts across stateLumpy Skin Disease is a viral outbreak that targets cattle and is transmitted by blood-feeding insects like mosquitoes, flies, lice and wasps by direct contact and also through contaminated food and water. The disease is characterised by the development of nodules in the skin, which may cover the whole of the animal's body, and lesions are often found in the mouth and upper respiratory tract.The disease is caused by a virus in the family Poxviridae, genus Capripoxvirus which affects cattle. \"Agro-climates, communal grazing, biting-fly, and introduction of new animals are associated with the occurrence of lumpy skin disease,\" a paper in Science Direct states.According to the National Library of Medicine at the National Centre for Biotechnology Information, the systemic effects include pyrexia, anorexia, dysgalactia and pneumonia, which leaves the animal with severe emaciation, loss of production for several months, infertility, and in extreme cases, death.Also Read | Maharashtra announces aid as 42 cattle succumb to lumpyThe first case of the Lumpy Skin Disease was reported in April in Gujarat's Kutch region and since then the outbreak has spread, through India including in the states of Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, and Punjab, among others. Delhi has over 200 cases of the infection and most cases have been detected in the southwest Delhi districts -- Goyla dairy area, Rewla Khanpur area, Ghumanhera and Najafgarh.Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde has asked state Animal Husbandry department officials to be alert and take steps to curb the spread of lumpy skin disease among cattle. The Nanded district administration in Maharashtra has banned the holding of cattle markets and ordered that animals infected by the lumpy skin disease cannot be brought into regular markets. The authorities said that attle coming into the Nanded district will be screened at the borders of the district.Milk collection across Rajasthan is estimated to have been reduced by 3 to 4 lakh litres per day after the onset of lumpy skin disease. According to Rajasthan Cooperative Dairy Federation (RCDF), in the month of June, about 20 lakh litre per day of milk was being collected at collection centers.The situation is no different in Jharkhand, where cases are on the rise.Yes, there is a vaccine against viral infection.So far, Sheepox virus (SPV) and goat pox virus (GPV) -based vaccines were being used to counter the disease. But now, Indian scientists have also developed an indigenous vaccine against LSD. The ICAR-National Research Centre on Equines (ICAR-NRCE) in collaboration with ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) has developed a vaccine against Lumpy Skin Disease.

    "content": "The UN report listing \u201cvictims of enforced disappearances\u201d in Bangladesh is replete with inaccuracies, with the leading academics and right activists raising questions over the shoddy job. The fact that two separatist insurgents, both back in India, figured in the UN list says a lot about the report.Dismayed over such \u201csloppy\u201d work, experts in Bangladesh have raised questions over the global body\u2019s over-reliance on some local non-government organisations (NGOs), who are close to or even run by the Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) workers. The BNP, for its part, has a blatant record of faking cases of human rights as validated through media reports and accounts from the country\u2019s known rights activists.Bangladesh's best known rights activist and lawyer Sultana Kamal said in an interview that the \u201cBNP has a history of faking cases of human rights\u201d, and called for \u201clegal action against the party\u201d.\u201cThe fake human rights abuse cases by the BNP has already damaged their image significantly\u201d, said Sultana Kamal in an interview with India Today.Meanwhile, the sensational case of the re-appearance of an aged woman, Rahima Begum, has also raised doubts about the UN report. Rahima Begum went into hiding on August 27 and was later found by police on September 24. This case brings into question the authenticity of claims about enforced disappearances made by some Bangladesh rights groups whose findings seem to influence the UN Working Group's report and the action of some foreign governments.Moriom Mannan, daughter of Rahima, first identified the picture of a dead body as that of her mother before the media. When Moriom was contacted by the police, she again identified her as her mother.\"The whole concept of evidence seeking has been opened to question,\" said a lawyer, Shahnaz Parvin Dolly.ALSO READ | Sheikh Hasina: The steady hands steering South Asia\u2019s youngest nation amidst global turbulenceProfessor Imtiaz Ahmed, who teaches international relations at Dhaka University, says the fake disappearance cases actually tend to discredit the entire rights issue scenario in Bangladesh.\"After including fake cases in their list, the entire UN report is called into question. And the groups who are responsible are actually damaging the cause of human rights in Bangladesh, \"Prof Imtiaz Ahmed said in an interview with the country\u2019s leading outlet Somoy TV.However, Imtiaz Ahmed, who once headed the Centre for Genocide Studies at Dhaka University, strongly pitched for strict action on enforced disappearances and said such cases should be brought down to zero.Now a careful look at the UN list has further pointed out many more glaring errors.The most startling instance smacking of double standards is the inclusion of sacked military official Hasinur Rahman in the UN list.Hasinur was found to violate his Army service conduct rules by staying in touch with outlawed radical outfits like Hizbut Tahrir, according to media reports published back in 2012. The Hizbut Tahrir deems all westerners as 'Murtad' (apostate), staunchly advocates introduction of Sharia, like in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, and seeks to end education rights for girls, something that Bengali women who make up half the country's population are opposed to.Hasinur was court-martialled, but is now happily attending talk-shows online, advocating for the BNP.PM Sheikh Hasina, ever since she returned to power in Jan 2009, has prioritised insulating the Bangladesh Army from radical influences or political influence. PM Sheikh Hasina\u2019s efforts have paid off, as is evident from the increasing role of the Bangladesh Army in UN Peacekeeping operations.Inclusion of cases of disappearances that took place long before the Awami League came to power has also raised questions over the intent of the list, especially because this UN Report on 'Enforced Disappearances ' seems to be a key document used by the US when it decided to issue sanctions against seven officers of the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), including outgoing police chief Benazir Ahmed.Kalpana Chakma, an activist in Chittagong Hill Tracts, went missing in June, 1996, days before the Awami League was voted back to power. According to reports, on 12 June 1996, at 1 am, a few hours before the general elections, six or seven army men in plainclothes forced their way into Kalpana's house and abducted her.Barisal Chhatra League's former cultural secretary, Mohammad Shafiqullah Monayem, went missing on December 1, 2007, long before the Awami League came to power. He disappeared when the country was ruled by a military-backed caretaker system that reportedly enjoyed support from western countries. In fact, Shafik happened to be a leader of the Awami League-backed student front.On May 25, 2008, Md Hasan Khan, who went missing during the same tenure of the army-backed caretaker government, also featured on the list.\u201cOf course, the current government needs to find out the whereabouts of those that went missing under previous regimes, but without mounting equal pressure on those very regimes responsible for such disappearances leaves a big question mark over the intention of such a group,\u201d said a Bangladeshi advocate.According to Bangladeshi media, at least 10 of those in the UN group's list of 76 enforced disappearances were staying with their families in Bangladesh. But there are at least 28 names on the UN list that have criminal charges against them.One person who was shown as \u201cdisappeared\u201d was found to have embarked on \u201ca solitary mission seeking divine blessings from some shrines\". Moreover, some of those on the UN list are not any innocent dissenters picked up by law enforcement agencies, but those who are absconding because they are wanted by the police in connection with serious crimes like murder and arson.Another BNP activist, accused of fire-bombing public vehicles, has been absconding since February 2015 to evade the police dragnet. Between 2013 and 2015, the BNP and the Jamaat e Islami cadres firebombed hundreds of public vehicles, leading to dozens of deaths and severe burn injuries, according to national and international outlets. The police registered cases against those accused and most of them absconded to evade arrest.Interestingly, another person who has been charged in several cases, like narcotics trafficking, arson and murder, is also listed in the UN Working Group report on 'Enforced Disappearances '. But according to sources, he has been staying in his home now after getting bail from the courts.\"To list all these absconders accused of serious crimes as victims of enforced disappearances is a travesty of justice. That the UN Working Group has bought into the preposterous narrative of some local NGOs like Odhikar is shameful,\" said the advocate.\"There are hundreds of absconders evading justice in the US or any other country. Can we dub them as victims of enforced disappearances? If that is not possible in the US, how does it become possible in Bangladesh?\" she questioned.\"If you start listing absconders fleeing justice as victims and deliberately overlook grave crimes they have committed, are you helping the cause of justice? The answer is an empathic no,\" she added.The list containing 76 persons handed over by the United Nations\u2019 Human Rights Council\u2019s Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances bears striking resemblance to similar lists first floated by local NGOs like Odhikar and then recycled by US-based Human Rights Watch and UK-based Amnesty International.The UN Report seems to have bought into these lists, overlooking grave factual errors.In an interview with Shomoy TV, Professor Imtiaz Ahmed said, \"How can an UN group just blindly accept the reports of biased local organisations which are headed by known opposition elements?\"Odhikar is headed by Adilur Rahman Khan Shuvro, a former deputy attorney general during the 2001-2006 BNP-JAMAAT government.Recently, the organisation lost its license for non compliance with government regulations. Back in 2013, when law enforcers flushed out Hefazat-e-Islam rioters who ran amok in the capital, Odhikar came out with a fact-finding report, \u201cAssembly of Hefazat-e Islam Bangladesh and Human Rights Violation\u201d.It was a composition of half-truths, biased and one-sided presentation of what happened on May 5 and in the early hours of May 6 in the capital, according to an analysis by a leading Bangladesh daily.Replete with imaginary death figures, the report drew flak from all the leading national outlets, while one daily termed it as \u201cfilled with imaginary figures\u201d. Notably, some of those who were cited as \u201cmissing activists\u201d were found giving quotes to the media. The inaccuracies did not end there. The report altered the geography of the nation as independent investigations found no village called Nimai Kachari in Bagmara where Odhikar claimed to have found \u201cdead people\u201d.\u201cIt is not wise or proper for any responsible organisation, let alone the UN to rely completely on the list provided by any organisation without verifying the contents with credible sources, particularly in terms of numbers and veracity of the cases, otherwise it undermines the gravity of the issue\u201d, observed longtime rights activist, Sultana Kamal.However, she also sounded caution, \u201cIt must also be kept in mind that mistake in the number or figures in a list do not automatically dismiss the issues in question or does not mean the complaints are totally wrong.\u201dSultana Kamal also blamed some Western rights bodies for double standards, saying they opposed the 1971 war crimes trials when it was necessary to try perpetrators of the Liberation War genocide.\u201cThe Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International's role regarding the trial of the war criminals was not fair. Also them not being vocal against war crimes committed in 1971 and not supporting Bangladesh's demand for global recognition of the genocide is no doubt disappointing,\" Sultana Kamal told India Today.Titled as \u201cSorry Khaleda\u201d, one of Bangladesh\u2019s leading media outlets earlier exposed how BNP leaders, including its chief Begum Zia, attempted to mislead the country with exaggerated figures of what it called \u201cmissing activists and leaders\u201d.Independent media reports investigated the high death figures in nine districts presented by the BNP chief Khaleda Zia and found them incorrect, exaggerated, and false.Khaleda, on February 4, 2014, had claimed that law enforcers and Awami League men had killed 242 BNP-led alliance men in 34 districts across the country. She, however, gave the names of only five of the victims (two cases of killing and three of forced disappearance).Upon cross-checking with local BNP leaders in the nine districts, newspapers found that there had been only 17 deaths during the period, as against 152 claimed by Khaleda.ALSO READ | On Sheikh Hasina\u2019s birthday, greetings from a fellow Bengali, and an appeal",

    "content": "Industrial-scale mining for materials such as coal, gold, and iron ore is spurring tropical deforestation, with once-impenetrable forest cleared for mines and access roads, new research shows.In the first study to quantify the impact of industrial mining on tropical forest loss, an international team of scientists found that just four countries are largely to blame: Brazil, Indonesia, Ghana and Suriname.Together, the four forest-rich nations accounted for roughly 80% of tropical deforestation caused by large-scale mining operations from 2000 to 2019, according to the study published on Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Also Read | Scientists warn ice-sheet collapse, coral die-off could happen anytimeWhile at least 70% of deforestation is done to clear land for agriculture, the scientists called out industrial mining as an emerging concern due to the growing global appetite for minerals used in clean-energy technologies to combat climate change.\"The energy transition is going to require very large amounts of minerals - copper, lithium, cobalt - for decarbonized technologies,\" said coauthor Anthony Bebbington, a geographer at Clark University in Massachusetts. \"We need more planning tools on the parts of governments and companies to mitigate the impacts of mining on forest loss.\"Already, mines worldwide extract more than twice the amount of raw materials than they did in 2000, the study said.For the study, the researchers studied global satellite images and data tracking forest loss alongside location information for industrial-scale mining operations from the past two decades. The study did not measure the impacts from small-scale and artisanal mining, which can also be a challenge as pollution goes unregulated.Overall, there were 26 countries responsible for most of the world's tropical deforestation since 2000.Also Read | PM Modi to introduce Cheetahs brought from Africa into MP's Kunno National Park on Sept 17But around industrial mining sites, the four countries dominated. The biggest losses were in Indonesia, where coal mines on the island of Borneo have expanded to meet fuel demand from China and India.Ghana and Suriname also showed high deforestation rates around gold and bauxite mines delivering material used in aluminum and other products. In Brazil, gold and iron ore extraction drove mining deforestation.Mining operations often clear forests to make room for expanding extraction sites and tailing storage facilities, as well as to build access roads and settlements for miners.Road-building and development activities are often not included in environmental impact assessments, conducted before a mine is approved, said environmental engineer Juliana Siqueira-Gay at the sustainability nonprofit Instituto Escolhas in Brazil, who was not involved in the study.Also Read | Why should melting Himalayas scare you?

Further, it aims to develop separate commands for the Army, Navy, and Air force under a unified command headed by a single commander.ALSO READ | Navy holds high level meeting on creation of Maritime Theatre CommandThe integration process would lead toward unified military assets under one operational head who would be responsible for directing and controlling their activities in a given situation.Besides the operational synergies, the theatre command system would contribute to more streamlined costs and a leaner fighting force.

Past and current economic and industrial booms of China, the United States and other leading economies are the biggest contributors to climate change, which is primarily caused by burning fossil fuels.ALSO READ | India exercises \u2018Right of Reply\u2019 against Pakistan foreign minister\u2019s remarks on Kashmir at UNThe roughly 30 million people in Pakistan reported to be displaced by the floods are \u201ctruly paying in the forms of their lives and their livelihoods for the industrialization of other countries,\u201d said Zardari.\u201cAnd justice would be that we work together\u201d globally, \u201cthat we\u2019re not left alone, to deal with the consequences of this tragedy,\u201d he said.Zardari is the son of a past Pakistani prime minister and a past president. He became foreign minister in April.He met with Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday. The Biden administration on the same day announced another $10 million in food aid for Pakistan, on top of more than $56 million in flood relief and humanitarian assistance this year.More broadly, however, the Biden administration and other governments of leading economic nations have delivered only a small part of the $100 billion in annual aid they have pledged to help less-wealthy nations survive the droughts, rising seas and other disasters of climate change and switch to cleaner energy themselves.ALSO READ | Audio clips between leaders of Pakistan govt leak, raises security concerns\u201cWe expect the United States to be one of the leading players\u201d in that, said Zardari, who also spoke approvingly of a nascent proposal out of the U.N. in which developed nations could cancel out existing debt as a form of climate aid.\u201cWe\u2019ve not yet seen \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t see \u2014 the translation of this vision to practicalities on the ground\u201d in terms of the overall climate aid, he said.Zardari, who spoke to the AP on Tuesday at Pakistan\u2019s embassy, also gave contentious recommendations that the U.S. work more directly with Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban. Pakistan and the United States have shared widely varying amounts of cooperation against violent armed groups sheltering in Afghanistan over the decades. The U.S. long has been at odds with many Pakistani officials over sympathetic handling and support for the Taliban.No country recognizes the Taliban, a group sanctioned as a terrorist organization that retook power by military force in August 2021, as Afghanistan\u2019s legitimate government. The United States and the international community at large have sought to deal with billions of dollars in frozen Afghan Central Bank funds, to institute financial reforms, and to deliver badly needed aid to ordinary Afghans with minimal involvement by the Taliban.\u201cAt the risk of hurting anyone\u2019s feelings, I think it\u2019s important to mention that these funds, it\u2019s not the Taliban\u2019s funds, it\u2019s not the Americans\u2019 funds. These are funds that belong to the people of Afghanistan,\u201d Zardari said.Economic isolation and privation such as Afghanistan has experienced since the Taliban takeover only feed authoritarianism and extremism, he said. The best financial outcomes would work through existing institutions, now in Taliban hands, not through \u201csome sort of parallel government.\u201dAsked if he meant the U.S. needed to hold its nose and deal with Afghanistan\u2019s ruling power, Zardari said, \u201cPretty much.\u201dMeanwhile, the U.S. discovery that the global leader of al-Qaida, Ayman al-Zawahiri, had taken up refuge in the heart of Afghanistan\u2019s capital since the Taliban had returned to power has left U.S. leaders condemning Taliban officials for alleged complicity. The U.S. killed Zawahiri in a drone strike in July.The Taliban had yet to have the time and ability to grapple with extremist groups as a government should, Zardari said. \u201cFor them to demonstrate their will to take on terrorist organizations, we need to help them build their capacity to also do so\u201d before judging them, he said.",

    "content": "Blue Origin, after successfully launching three tourism flights into space this year, was hoping for a fourth successful mission late on Monday evening. But, not all was well with the launch vehicle.Just over a minute after launching from Launch Site One in West Texas, the spacecraft triggered an emergency abort, which activated the escape system, jettisoning the crew capsule away from the booster in a synergised dance of computational algorithms and aerospace engineering.The good news \u2014 there were no humans on board this time, and if there were, the system showed they would have been safe.Also Read | Blue Origin rocket fails minutes after launch, escapes near deathThe spacecraft was carrying 36 payloads from academia, research institutions, and students across the globe into space, which came down thudding to the surface of the planet under a parachute. Two of the payloads were flying on the exterior of the New Shepard booster for ambient exposure to the space environment.The crew escape system is a unique attribute of space flights that is designed to save lives and assets in case of eventualities after launch.According to the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), it is an emergency escape measure designed to quickly pull the crew module along with the astronauts to a safe distance from the launch vehicle in the event of a launch abort. The Indian space agency in 2018 tested the unique ability and is preparing for two such abort missions to test the systems for the Gaganyaan crewed mission that is scheduled for next year.Also Read | Nasa delays Artemis-1 mission to Moon, launch now on this dateThe Crew Escape System is also part of the Artemis-1 mission, which is preparing to launch on its maiden mission to the Moon. The abort system comprises of three solid rocket motors: the abort motor pulls the crew module away from the rocket; the attitude control motor steers and orients the capsule; then the jettison motor ignites to separate the launch abort system from Orion for parachute deployment and a safe crew landing.Nasa has said that the launch abort system will safely lift the Orion crew module away from the Space Launch System rocket in the event of an emergency on the launch pad or during ascent.Blue Origin blamed the failure of the mission to a booster anomaly as it hit the ground seconds after the crew capsule was blasted away from it.\"During today\u2019s flight, the capsule escape system successfully separated the capsule from the booster. The booster impacted the ground. There are no reported injuries; all personnel have been accounted for,\" Blue Origin said in a statement.While the boosters' engines flared unexpectedly during ascent as seen in the Livestream, the company-led by Jeff Bezos is yet to release any more information about the reason that the abort was triggered.Blue Origin's fleet of New Shepard rockets is grounded until the FAA signs off on the outcome of a company-led investigation into the mishap.Also Read | Astronomers look back in time to see a star that exploded 600 years ago",

This would reduce the temptation towards competitive populism,\" the eminent economist argued.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has in recent days hit out at the competitive populism of extending 'rewaris' (freebies) which are not just wastage of taxpayers' money but also an economic disaster that could hamper India's drive to become atmanirbhar (self-reliant).His comments were seen directed at parties like the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) which have in the run-up to assembly elections in states like Punjab and more recently Gujarat promised free electricity and water, among others.Earlier this month, the Supreme Court had suggested setting up a specialised body to examine \"irrational freebies\" offered to voters during elections.On India's macroeconomic situation, Goyal, currently emeritus professor at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, said, \"Indian growth is sustaining despite continuing global shocks and rate rises.\"While observing that India has done better than most expectations and in comparison to many countries under challenging conditions, she said among reasons for this are growing economic diversity that helps to absorb shocks.\"Large domestic demand can moderate a global slowdown; if industry suffers from lockdown, agriculture does well,\" she said, adding that services compensate for less contact-based delivery with digitisation, distance work and exports.According to Goyal, even if global growth slows, diversification from China, India's digital advantage and government efforts to promote exports would support India's outbound shipments.Emphasising that a rise in the currently very small Indian share in world exports remains feasible, Goyal said diversity and reforms in the financial sector have improved its stability.\"Coordinated fiscal and monetary policy action to reduce inflation while maintaining adequate demand has worked well. Rising real policy rates have prevented over-heating and anchored inflation expectations, as they approach positive values,\" she noted.The Reserve Bank's MPC at its meeting from August 3 to 5 had decided to increase the benchmark lending rate by 50 basis points to 5.40 per cent to quell inflation. This was the third consecutive increase since May.Asked whether high inflation will become the norm in India and if the country's inflation targeting regime faces its biggest test at the moment, Goyal said, \"The big test is already past and looks like flexible inflation targeting (FIT) is winning.\"Pointing out that inflation peaked in April and has been falling since then, she said July was only the sixth month when inflation slightly exceeded the tolerance band but it has reversed and may fall below 6 per cent before October or slightly later.\"Inflation expectations have fallen. The attempt will be to further slowly guide them towards the target in a soft landing, even as a robust growth recovery takes hold,\" Goyal said.The retail inflation was at 7.01 per cent in June and eased to 6.71 per cent in July. RBI has been mandated by the government to ensure that inflation remains at 4 per cent with a margin of 2 per cent on either side.Replying to a question on weakening of the Indian rupee, Goyal said the dollar has strengthened against all currencies because of the strong US recovery and rising interest rates.\"But Indian reserves and forex intervention has ensured the rupee depreciation was only about half of the USD rise and much less compared to other countries,\" she said, adding the intervention is aimed at smoothing excess over- or under-shooting while letting the market determine exchange rates.Goyal noted that some nominal depreciation is required in line with the country's major export competitors and its excess inflation.\"India's depreciation is about the same as China's,\" she said.",

    "content": "External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday met his American counterpart Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington DC for bilateral talks, during which he raised concerns about the recent F-16 maintenance package for Pakistan.In a press conference following the talks, US Secretary of State Blinken justified the decision by saying it would help Pakistan in its counter-terrorism efforts.\"To be very clear, this is a sustainment programme for F-16s that Pakistan has long had. These are old plans and systems that they already have. We have a responsibility and obligation to whoever we provide military supplies to maintain and sustain them,\" Blinken said.\"Pakistan\u2019s programme bolsters its capability to fight terror and terrorist threats emanating from Pakistan or from the region. It is in no one's interest for them to go forward with impunity. This capability that Pakistan has can benefit all of us in dealing with terrorism,\" he added.Read | Washington's responsibility, obligation: US State Secy Antony Blinken defends US-Pakistan F-16 fleet dealWhile Jaishankar did not respond to the F-16 question at the joint briefing, he did raise concerns about the \"merits\" of the US-Pakistan relationship during an interaction with Indian-Americans on Sunday.\"For someone to say I am doing this because it is all counter-terrorism content, and when you are talking about something like the capability of an F-16, which everybody knows, and you know where they are deployed and their use, you are not fooling anybody by saying these things,\" Jaishankar said.The US State Department has approved a Foreign Military Sale (FMS) to the Government of Pakistan for the sustainability of the Pakistan Air Force F-16 fleet and equipment at a cost of USD 450 million.However, without naming Pakistan, Jaishankar said, \"We particularly value closer coordination in the Indian subcontinent where we perceive that our convergences are very strong. It is essential that democracy, pluralism, progress, development, and prosperity are nurtured. Conversely, we must counter radicalism, extremism, and fundamentalism.\"\"India is widening its international footprint, and there are many more regions where we would be intersecting with American interests. It is to our mutual benefit that this be a complimentary process,\" he added.Read | US-Pakistan ties did not serve either nation: Jaishankar on F-16 fleet dealThe two sides discussed a wide range of issues, ranging from bilateral to regional to global. India expressed concern about visa delays, which have impacted the lives of students, businesses, and even families who have been unable to meet. He was also optimistic about the crisis' resolution.\"On mobility, specifically visas, this is particularly crucial, given its centrality to education, business, technology, and family reunions; there have been some challenges of late, and I flagged it to Secretary Blinken and his team, and I have every confidence that they will look at some of these problems seriously and positively,\" said Jaishankar.The two sides also discussed counter-terrorism and praised each other's efforts to apprehend wanted terrorists.\"I also expressed appreciation for the strong cooperation that we have gotten from the U.S. on the question of tackling international terrorism. In particular, I refer to the listing of well-known and wanted terrorists by the UN sanctions process. In many other formats too, our two countries collaborate to keep the world safer and more secure,\" said Jaishankar.Secretary Blinken brought up the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the need for it to end. Reminding reporters of Prime Minister Modi's recent remarks about ending the war, he said, \"PM Modi said in Uzbekistan that 'today's era is not of war.'He also stated at the UNGA, \"We are on the side that respects the UN Charter and its founding principles. And so is the United States.\"\"Food security is also an important challenge. We focused on it during the week in New York. We should be part of the solution to find durable ways to deal with the crisis. Each of these crises has been exacerbated by Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, and therefore we continue to marshal pressure on President Putin to end this war,\" Blinken had said.While India has expressed concern about US-Pakistan military ties, the US has asked India to reduce its reliance on Russia.The United States also advocated for the expansion of the Security Council, which truly represents the new global order. Blinken stated in that context, \"UN members must not only uphold the charter but also modernise the Security Council and make it more inclusive. President Biden in his address to the UNGA spoke on expansion of membership, which includes countries we have long supported and countries in Latin America, Africa, and the Caribbean.\"Read | So they can match us : Ex-India envoy's concern over US-Pak F-16 aid",

Meanwhile, a rights group claimed that over 75 people have been killed in the protests amid clashes with security forces.The Iranian authorities' official death count, however, remained at 41, including several members of the security forces.The women in Iran have been publicly chopping off their hair and burning their hijabs to protest against the country's draconian laws. People are chanting 'Death to the Dictator', calling for the end of the three-decade rule of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader.The Iranian government has dismissed the protest as a 'foreign plot' rather than the expression of public outrage over Mahsa Amini's death. There were also some pro-government marches in the city where the marchers chanted, \"American mercenaries are fighting the religion.\"The government\u2019s decision to restrict Instagram, LinkedIn and WhatsApp \u2014 three of the last Western social media apps working in the country \u2014 has limited the ability of protesters to organize and share their videos with the outside world.Instead, only short clips find their way out, including those of security forces firing at protesters and women defiantly cutting off their hair and burning their hijabs.

    "content": "The Taliban have signed a provisional deal with Russia to supply gasoline, diesel, gas and wheat to Afghanistan, Acting Afghan Commerce and Industry Minister Haji Nooruddin Azizi told Reuters.Azizi said his ministry was working to diversify its trading partners and that Russia had offered the Taliban administration a discount to average global commodity prices.The move, the first known major international economic deal struck by the Taliban since they returned to power more than a year ago, could help to ease the Islamist movement's isolation that has effectively cut it off from the global banking system.No country formally recognises the group, which fought a 20-year insurgency against Western forces and their local Afghan allies before sweeping into Kabul as U.S. troops withdrew.Western diplomats have said the group needs to change its course on human rights, particularly those of women, and prove it has cut ties with international militant groups in order to gain formal recognition.Russia does not officially recognise the Taliban's government, but Moscow hosted leaders of the movement in the run-up to the fall of Kabul and its embassy is one of only a handful to remain open in the Afghan capital.Azizi said the deal would involve Russia supplying around one million tonnes of gasoline, one million tonnes of diesel, 500,000 tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and two million tonnes of wheat annually.Russia's energy and agriculture ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the agreement. The office of Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, who is in charge of oil and gas, also did not immediately respond.ALSO READ | Leaks on Russian gas pipelines raise concerns about sabotageAzizi said the agreement would run for an unspecified trial period, after which both sides were expected to sign a longer term deal if they were content with the arrangement.He declined to give details on pricing or payment methods, but said Russia had agreed to a discount to global markets on goods that would be delivered to Afghanistan by road and rail.The deal was finalised after an Afghan technical team spent several weeks in discussions in Moscow, having stayed on after Azizi visited there last month.Since the Taliban regained power, Afghanistan has been plunged into economic crisis after development aid upon which the country relied was cut and amid sanctions that have largely frozen the banking sector.The trade deal is likely to be watched closely in the United States, whose officials have held regular talks with the Taliban on plans for the country's banking system.Washington has announced the creation of a Swiss trust fund for some of the Afghan central bank reserves held in the United States. The Taliban have demanded the release of the entire amount of around $7 billion and said the funds should be used for central bank operations.Azizi said international data showed most Afghans were living below the poverty line, and his office was working to support trade and the economy through international outreach.\"Afghans are in great need,\" he said. \"Whatever we do, we do it based on national interest and the people's benefit.\"He said Afghanistan also received some gas and oil from Iran and Turkmenistan and had strong trade ties with Pakistan, but also wanted to diversify.\"A country ... shouldn't be dependent on just one country, we should have alternative ways,\" he said.The Group of Seven (G7) nations are trying to find ways to limit Russia's oil export earnings in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine in February.Moscow has managed to maintain revenues through increased crude sales to Asia, particularly China and India. The European Union will ban Russian crude imports by Dec. 5 and Russian oil products by Feb. 5.",

It made landfall as a Category 3 storm on the island\u2019s western end, devastating Pinar del R\u00edo province, where much of the tobacco used for Cuba\u2019s iconic cigars is grown.Tens of thousands of people were evacuated and others fled the area ahead of the arrival of Ian, which caused flooding, damaged houses and blew toppled trees. Authorities were still assessing the damage, although no victims had been reported by Tuesday night.Ian\u2019s winds damaged one of Cuba\u2019s most important tobacco farms in La Robaina.\u201cIt was apocalyptic, a real disaster,\u201d said Hirochi Robaina, owner of the farm that bears his name and that his grandfather made known internationally.ALSO READ | Something we have never seen before: Florida braces for Hurricane Ian's impactRobaina, also the owner of the Finca Robaina cigar producer, posted photos on social media of wood-and-thatch roofs smashed to the ground, greenhouses in rubble and wagons overturned.State media said Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel visited the affected region.Cuba\u2019s Meteorology Institute said the city of Pinar del R\u00edo was in the worst of the hurricane for an hour and a half.\u201cBeing in the hurricane was terrible for me, but we are here alive,\u201d said Pinar del Rio resident Yusim\u00ed Palacios, who asked authorities for a roof and a mattress.Officials had set up 55 shelters, evacuated 50,000 people, and took steps to protect crops, especially tobacco.The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Cuba suffered \u201csignificant wind and storm surge impacts\u201d when the hurricane struck with top sustained winds of 125 mph (205 kph).Ian was expected to get even stronger over the warm Gulf of Mexico, reaching top winds of 130 mph (209 kph) approaching the southwestern coast of Florida, where 2.5 million people were ordered to evacuate.As the storm\u2019s center moved into the Gulf, scenes of destruction emerged in Cuba. Authorities were still assessing the damage in its world-famous tobacco belt.Local government station TelePinar reported heavy damage at the main hospital in Pinar del Rio city, tweeting photos of collapsed ceilings and downed trees. No deaths were reported.\u201cI spent the hurricane at home with my husband and the dog. The masonry and zinc roof of the house had just been installed. But the storm tore it down,\u201d said Mercedes Vald\u00e9s, who lives along the highway connecting Pinar del R\u00edo to San Juan y Mart\u00ednez. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t rescue our things ... we just ran out.\u201d",

    "content": "Russian-installed officials in four occupied regions of Ukraine reported huge majorities of votes in favour of joining Russia as the United States planned a UN resolution condemning the referendums as shams and Moscow remained defiant.Europe was investigating what Germany, Sweden and Denmark said on Tuesday were attacks that caused major leaks from two Russian energy pipelines. But it remained far from clear who might be behind the leaks.Hastily arranged votes took place over five days in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk and in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson to the south, which together make up about 15 per cent of Ukrainian territory.Vote tallies from complete results on Tuesday in the four provinces ranged from 87 per cent to 99.2 per cent in favour of joining Russia, according to Russia-appointed officials. The head of the upper house of the Russian parliament said the chamber might consider annexation on October 4.\"The results are clear. Welcome home to Russia!,\" Dmitry Medvedev, a former president who serves as deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council and an ally of President Vladimir Putin, said on Telegram.Within the occupied territories, Russian-installed officials took ballot boxes from house to house in what Ukraine and the West said was an illegitimate, coercive exercise to create a legal pretext for Russia to annex the four regions.\"This farce in the occupied territories cannot even be called an imitation of a referendum,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address on Tuesday.The United States will introduce a resolution at the United Nations Security Council calling on member states not to recognise any change to Ukraine and obligating Russia to withdraw its troops, U.S. envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield said.\"Russia\u2019s sham referendum, if accepted, will open a pandora\u2019s box that we cannot close,\" she said at a council meeting.Russia has the ability to veto a resolution in the Security Council, but Thomas-Greenfield said that would prompt Washington to take the issue to the UN General Assembly.\"Any referenda held under these conditions, at the barrel of a gun, can never be remotely close to free or fair,\" Britain's Deputy UN Ambassador James Kariuki said.Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vassily Nebenzia, told the meeting that the referendums were conducted transparently and upholding electoral norms.\"This process is going to continue if Kyiv does not recognise its mistakes and its strategic errors and doesn't start to be guided by the interests of its own people and not blindly carry out the will of those people who are playing them,\" he said.READ | \u2018Won\u2019t let Putin turn me into a killer\u2019: Russians flee across border after news of draftIf Russia annexes the four Ukrainian regions, Putin could portray any Ukrainian attempt to recapture them as an attack on Russia itself. He said last week he was willing to use nuclear weapons to defend the \"territorial integrity\" of Russia, and Medvedev issued a new nuclear warning on Tuesday to Ukraine and the West.But Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, told Reuters that Kyiv would not be swayed by nuclear threats or by the annexation votes, and would press on with plans to retake all territory occupied by invading Russian forces.Diplomats say the nuclear sabre-rattling is an attempt by Moscow to scare the West into reducing its support for Kyiv.For the first time, Medvedev predicted that the Nato military alliance would not directly enter the Ukraine war even if Moscow struck Ukraine with nuclear weapons.Putin said on state TV the votes were designed to protect people from what he has called the persecution of ethnic Russians and Russian speakers by Ukraine, something Kyiv denies.\"Saving people in all the territories where this referendum is being held is ... the focus of attention of our entire society and country,\" Putin said.He earlier discussed with officials the mobilisation of farmers to fight in Ukraine, the latest step in a campaign he announced last week to support what Moscow calls its \"special military operation\" after this month's battlefield reverses.The mobilisation drive has sent thousands of Russians rushing to cross Russian borders into neighbouring countries.Podolyak said Ukrainians who had helped Russia organise the annexation referendums would face treason charges and at least five years in jail. Ukrainians who were forced to vote would not be punished.READ | Russia admits to making mistake after old, sick people mobilised for Ukraine warNone of the four regions is fully under Moscow's control and there has been fighting along the entire front line, with Ukrainian forces reporting more advances since they routed Russian troops in a fifth province, Kharkiv, earlier this month.Zelenskyy said the Donetsk region in the east remained his country's - and Russia's - top strategic priority, with \"particularly severe\" fighting engulfing several towns.The general staff of Ukraine's military said late Tuesday that Russian shelling hit seven towns in Donetsk, including Bakhmut, Soledar and Avdiivka.The military said 20 towns in the Zaporizhzhia region in south-central Ukraine and 35 towns and villages in the Kherson region in the south were also hit.Leonid Pasechnik, a separatist leader of Luhansk, said on Telegram three municipal gas workers were killed and another injured by Ukrainian shelling in Brianka.\"Their goal is to kill as many civilians as possible ... and destroy the infrastructure in towns. The missiles supplied by Nato countries are killing unarmed children, women, elderly people and municipal utility workers,\" he said.Reuters could not immediately verify battlefield reports.READ | 'Putin cornered, might go nuclear': Ex-CIA official on Russia-Ukraine war",

    "content": "Hotels and restaurants can levy service charges from customers on food bills till August 31, when the Delhi High Court will hear the Centre's appeal against a court order that stayed its guidelines on service charges.The court in its previous hearing had asked why restaurants recover service charges from consumers as an additional and separate levy. Ahead of the next hearing, we take a look at the issue involving service charges and what various stakeholders have said about the same.Hotels and restaurants automatically levy service charges on customers in the range of 5-10 per cent over and above the food bills. The consumer affairs department later received complaints from consumers about the compulsory charge.The government then held a meeting with hotels and restaurants on June 2 and asked the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) to immediately stop the \"illegal\" practice.Within two days, the regulatory authority Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) issued guidelines to prevent hotels and restaurants from levying service charges. The new guidelines stated that eateries should not add service charge automatically or by default on food bills.READ | Delhi High Court okays levying service charge till next hearing, issues notice to restaurantsThe National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) and the Federation of Hotels and Restaurant Associations of India challenged this move in Delhi High Court and on July 20, a single judge bench stayed the government guidelines.The Centre then filed an appeal against this order and the matter will be taken up again on August 31.The consumer affairs ministry said there is no legal sanctity attached to service charge and it will come out with a legal framework to end this practice.Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma told the high court on August 16 that while the service charge is in the nature of a tip, the impression given to consumers is as if it is a governmental levy or a governmental tax.\"The consumers face embarrassment when they don't pay or they are asked to pay. That is the reason hundreds of complaints were received,\" he said.The Centre further said in its appeal that the impugned order was passed without appreciating that the guidelines have been issued for safeguarding the rights and interests of the consumers.ALSO READ | 'Don't enter, don't pay': Delhi HC stays guidelines banning service charges at restaurants\"It was passed post-haste without appreciating that the guidelines seek to protect the consumers from unfair trade practices and violation of consumer rights due to mandatory collection of service charge and adding such charge automatically or by default in the food bill without allowing the consumer the choice or discretion to decide whether they want to pay such charge or not,\" the Centre said in its appeal.Restaurant associations have said that the service charge was not a government levy and it was for the benefit of the restaurant employees and was not a substitute for \"tips\".Counsels appearing for restaurants also said in court that the government does not prohibit service charges and when it is made clear by the restaurant that there would be a levy of service charge, it becomes a matter of contract.\"Levy of service charge has been a standing practice in the hospitality industry for more than 80 years. It has a socio-economic angle. The system of levying service charges ensures that there is a systematic and logical distribution of service charge collection amongst the employees and not just the employee serving the customer in the restaurant. This ensures that the benefit is divided equally among all the staff workers including the utility workers and back staff,\" NRAI had said, while opposing the Centre's guidelines.On July 20, while staying the guidelines banning the service charge, the Delhi High Court said, \u201cDon\u2019t pay. Don\u2019t enter the restaurant. It\u2019s a matter of choice.\"The court further asked the eateries to prominently display the levy of service charge on their menus and other places.While hearing the Centre's appeal on August 16, the Delhi High Court remarked that restaurants can increase food prices to absorb this charge instead of recovering it in the form of an additional charge over and above the total bill.ALSO READ | Centre moves Delhi High Court over ban on service charge at restaurants\"Increase your food prices. No problem. Because you are entitled to fix a rate for your food but don't levy it separately,\" the court told the restaurant associations, adding that service charge is connected to consumers and not just the employees.The high court bench of Delhi Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad also allowed the Centre and the CCPA to make a submission before the single-judge bench on pleas challenging the guidelines, which will now hear the case on August 31. For the time being, eateries can levy service charges on customers.",

There is high confidence that changes in heat waves, glacial retreat, and/or permafrost degradation will affect high mountain phenomena such as slope instabilities, movements of mass, and glacial lake outburst floods,\" the report stated.Also Read | Scientists warn ice-sheet collapse, coral die-off could happen anytimeThe 594-page report\u2019s 20-page summary highlighted five case studies of climate risks from worsening extreme weather that scientists said will be more of a problem and how governments could deal with them. In each case scientists were able to give a recent example:\u201cA changing climate leads to changes in the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration, and timing of extreme weather and climate events, and can result in unprecedented extreme weather and climate events,\u201d the IPCC report said.Heatwaves: Several parts of the world, including India and Pakistan have been hit by record heatwaves that have led to several deaths.

The report said that for 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming, there will be increased heat waves, longer warm seasons, and shorter cold seasons.Extreme weather events have exposed millions of people to acute food and water insecurity, especially in Africa, Asia, Central, and South America, on Small Islands, and in the Arctic.Also Read | Why should melting Himalayas scare you?

The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) has, reportedly, run out of propellant, making it difficult to be revived in the Red Planet\u2019s orbit.This development is fuelling speculation that the mission is finally over. The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), which operates the spacecraft around Mars, is yet to say anything on the matter of whether the probe can be revived or not.Sources told news agency PTI that there is no fuel left in Mangalyaan. \"Right now, there is no fuel left. The satellite battery has drained,\" sources in the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) told PTI, adding that the link has been lost.\u201cRecently there were back-to-back eclipses including one that lasted seven-and-half hours.

The spacecraft was a demonstration mission aimed at establishing that India could design, launch and operate a mission on another world.Developed at just Rs 450 crore, the mission to Mars from India was one of the most cost-effective interplanetary missions ever designed.The spacecraft was equipped with five instruments to study the Martian surface features, morphology, mineralogy and the Martian atmosphere.

Former Isro chief K Sivan, during his tenure in 2021, said Mangalyaan-2 will be undertaken only after the launch of Chandrayaan-3, India's upcoming Moon mission.

Her party, Brothers of Italy, won big with various agencies estimating that it won around 25 per cent of the vote.Giorgia Meloni was brought up by a single mother after her father abandoned them after her birth. At 15, she joined a local youth section of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), created by supporters of the disgraced fascist dictator Benito Mussolini.In the mid 1990s, the MSI became a part of a new body called the National Alliance (AN) and then merged with a mainstream conservative group created by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.In 2012, Meloni and other members of the AN left the group and co-founded Brothers of Italy, named after the opening lines of the national anthem.In an interview with Reuters, Meloni compared her party to the US Republican Party and Britain's Conservative Party. The party gives importance to patriotism and traditional family values.Meloni's formal entry into politics was at age 21, when she won her first local election. She was also Italy's youngest ever minister at age 31 when she was given the youth portfolio in Berlusconi's 2008 government.The image that came to define Meloni was cemented by a speech that she made in 2019. \"I am Giorgia, I am a woman, I am a mother, I am Italian, I am a Christian, and you can't take that away from me,\" she told cheering supporters.Meet Giorgia Meloni, Italy's first female Prime Minister. pic.twitter.com/RHMYYS1rPnIn another speech given in June, Meloni spoke in support of \"natural families\" and opposed \"sexual identity and the LGBT lobby\". \"Yes to natural families, no to the LGBT lobby, yes to sexual identity, no to gender ideology, yes to the culture of life, no to the abyss of death,\" she said while addressing the supporters of the Spanish rightist party Vox.\"No to the violence of Islam, yes to safer borders, no to mass immigration, yes to work for our people, no to major international finance,\" she added.Meloni is chair of the right-wing European Conservative and Reformist group in the European Parliament, which includes her Brothers of Italy, Poland\u2019s nationalist Law and Justice Party, Spain\u2019s far-right Vox and the right-wing Sweden Democrats.(With input from Reuters)",

    "content": "The acting U.N. human rights chief on Monday urged European Union member states to avoid \u201cbacktracking\u201d on their efforts to develop renewables and energy-efficiency projects at a time when soaring energy prices have prompted some to ramp up use of and searches for fossil fuels.Nada al-Nashif, the acting U.N. high commissioner for human rights, laid out rights concerns about more than 30 countries, regions and territories including Ethiopia, Ukraine, Myanmar and Haiti in an opening speech to the latest session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva.Beyond expressing concerns about the direct impact of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, she noted how the war has dented exports of food and fuel from those two countries - that are major producers of both - forcing EU states, for example, to scramble for more energy sources.Also Read | Small nuke reactors emerge as energy option, but risks loom\u201cIn the face of soaring energy prices which threaten to impact the most vulnerable as winter approaches, some EU member states are turning to investments in fossil fuels infrastructure and supplies,\u201d al-Nashif said.While such an impulse was \u201cunderstandable,\u201d she warned of the long-term consequences of boosting use of fossil fuels that contribute to global warming and called for faster development of energy-efficiency projects and renewables.\u201cThere is no room for backtracking in the face of the ongoing climate crisis,\u201d she said.In Germany, the EU\u2019s biggest economy, use of carbon-spewing coal rose as a share of the country\u2019s total electricity production in the first half of 2022 compared with a year earlier. The Dutch government this summer issued permits for a joint gas exploration project with Germany.Also Read | Scientists warn ice-sheet collapse, coral die-off could happen anytimeEU nations have been looking to tap new sources of natural gas to help them wean themselves off supplies from Russia.Al-Nashif made only passing reference to a report raising concerns about China\u2019s controversial campaign to fight terrorism and extremism in Western Xinjiang that could at times have amounted to \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d against Uyghurs and other minorities. It was released in the waning minutes of the tenure of former rights chief Michelle Bachelet. Beijing lashed out at the report, calling it part of a plot by Western nations to block China\u2019s rise.Al-Nashif has held the temporary post since the term of former Chilean President Bachelet expired on Aug. 31. Her successor \u2014 Austrian diplomat and U.N. veteran Volker T\u00fcrk -- takes over the job in coming days.The four-week autumn session at the council, which brings together 47 U.N. member states, is expected to take up \u201ccountry situations\u201d in many places including Afghanistan, Congo, Myanmar, Ukraine and Venezuela.Also Read | New global review of regulatory approaches to implement regional action released",

The 28-year-old is considered to be one of the first names on the team sheet at the T20 World Cup in Australia this month.Speaking to NDTV, Watson heaped praise on the India all-rounder and said that he is at the peak of his powers at the moment and said it is an absolute treat to watch him play.\"Hardik is absolutely at the peak of his powers at this moment. It is an absolute treat to watch him play. I love watching fast-bowling all-rounders who steam in and have a real crack. You know, the impact they can have and they can take the game away from the opposition at any time of the game, whether it is with the bat and ball,\" said Watson.Pandya has often been compared with Stokes when it comes to T20 cricket as many consider them to be the best in the business at the moment. However, Watson was very clear with his choice and said that the India all-rounder is far ahead of the England test captain when it comes to T20 cricket. He said that with his batting, bowling and other attributes, Pandya is truly the stand-out amongst the two all-rounders.\"It is really pleasing to see Hardik playing like he is doing right now. And in regards to T20 cricket, Hardik is way above where Ben Stokes is right now. With the way Hardik is batting, his versatility while batting at the end, the way he is bowling. Right now, at this moment, Hardik is the stand-out,\" said Watson.",

    "content": "What happens when a star explodes? What happens if our sun explodes and disappears?These are some of the questions that ponder astronomers interested in studying stellar explosions, supernovas, and some of the brightest cosmic blasts happening at the edge of time. A group of astronomers have now turned back the clock and analysed a star by determining a timeline of its demise.Astronomers analyzed the remnants of supernova SNR 0519 located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small galaxy 160,000 light-years from Earth. It was formed when a white dwarf star exploded. The thermonuclear explosion was either by pulling matter from a companion star or by merging with another white dwarf and destroying itself in the process.Also Read | Nasa delays Artemis-1 mission to Moon, launch now on this dateThe analysis of such explosions is critical to better understanding thermonuclear explosions and measuring distances to galaxies across billions of light-years. To understand how long ago the star in SNR 0519 exploded and learn about the environment the supernova occurred in, a host of telescopes were used.Astronomers used X-ray data from NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory and optical data from NASA\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope and combined them with observations from the retired Spitzer Space telescope. The composite image shows low, medium, and high energies as seen in green, blue, and purple respectively, with some of these colors overlapping to appear white.The team compared images taken by the Hubble from 2010, 2011, and 2020 to measure the speeds of material in the blast wave from the explosion, which ranges to 9 million kilometers per hour. \"If the speed was toward the upper end of those estimated speeds, the astronomers determined that light from the explosion would have reached Earth about 670 years ago, or during the Hundred Years\u2019 War between England and France and the height of the Ming dynasty in China,\" Nasa said in a release.Also Read | Nasa's Juno probe to touch Europa, the moon with more water than EarthAstronomers, however, believe that the movement of material has slowed down and that the explosion happened earlier than 670 years. Nasa added that astronomers found the brightest regions in X-rays of the remnant are where the slowest-moving material is located, and no X-ray emission is associated with the fastest-moving material.Their findings were published in the August issue of The Astrophysical Journal, which states that some of the blast waves have crashed into dense gas around the remnant, causing it to slow down as it traveled.The team is now working to use additional observations with Hubble to determine more precisely when the time of the star\u2019s demise should truly be set.Also Read | European orbiter solves mystery around Sun's changing magnetic field",

    "content": "The government on Thursday hiked the windfall profit tax on the export of diesel to Rs 7 per litre and brought back a tax on jet fuel exports, but slashed the levy on domestically produced crude oil in line with softening rates.At the third fortnightly review, the government raised the windfall profit tax on the export of diesel to Rs 7 per litre from Rs 5 a litre and brought a Rs 2 a litre tax on ATF exports, a finance ministry notification showed.Earlier this month, the government had scrapped the windfall profit tax on ATF (Aviation Turbine Fuel) exports.Alongside, the tax on domestically produced crude oil has been cut to Rs 13,000 per tonne from Rs 17,750.The tax on exports has been raised as cracks or margins rose but the same on domestically produced oil was reduced as international oil prices slid to a six-month low.India first imposed windfall profit taxes on July 1, joining a growing number of nations that taxes super normal profits of energy companies. But international oil prices have cooled since then, eroding profit margins of both oil producers and refiners.On July 1, export duties of Rs 6 per litre (USD 12 per barrel) were levied on petrol and ATF and a Rs 13 a litre tax on the export of diesel (USD 26 a barrel). A Rs 23,250 per tonne windfall profit tax on domestic crude production (USD 40 per barrel) was also levied.Thereafter, in the first fortnightly review on July 20, the Rs 6 a litre export duty on petrol was scrapped, and the tax on the export of diesel and jet fuel (ATF) was cut by Rs 2 per litre each to Rs 11 and Rs 4, respectively. The tax on domestically produced crude was also cut to Rs 17,000 per tonne.Thereafter, on August 2, the export tax on diesel was cut to Rs 5 a litre and that on ATF scrapped, following a drop in refinery cracks or margins. But the levy on domestically produced crude oil was raised to Rs 17,750 per tonne in line with a marginal increase in international crude prices.At the third fortnightly review, the taxes on fuel exports has been raised but that on domestically produced crude oil has been cut.The reduction in taxes earlier this month came as India's trade gap swelled to a record high in July as elevated commodity prices and a weak rupee inflated the country's import bill.The gap between exports and imports widened to USD 31.02 billion in July from USD 26.18 billion in June. This, as a result of exports falling and elevated commodity prices together with a weak rupee, are inflating the import bill. Imports jumped 43.59 per cent in July from the year-ago month, while exports dropped 0.76 per cent.International oil prices have since then slid to below USD 95 per barrel but cracks on diesel and ATF rose.Industry sources said the government is working on a principle to leave some healthy margins, with both crude oil producers and refiners and taxing gains over and above that.",

    "content": "A global search for alternative sources to Russian energy during the war in Ukraine has refocused attention on smaller, easier-to-build nuclear power stations, which proponents say could provide a cheaper, more efficient alternative to older model mega-plants.UK-based Rolls-Royce SMR says its small modular reactors, or SMRs, are much cheaper and quicker to get running than standard plants, delivering the kind of energy security that many nations are seeking. France already relies on nuclear power for a majority of its electricity, and Germany kept the option of reactivating two nuclear plants it will shut down at the end of the year as Russia cuts natural gas supplies.While Rolls-Royce SMR and its competitors have signed deals with countries from Britain to Poland to start building the stations, they are many years away from operating and cannot solve the energy crisis now hitting Europe. Nuclear power also poses risks, including disposing of highly radioactive waste and keeping that technology out of the hands of rogue countries or nefarious groups that may pursue a nuclear weapons program.Those risks have been accentuated following the shelling around Europe\u2019s largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, which has raised fears of potential nuclear disaster.In the wake of the war, however, \u201cthe reliance on gas imports and Russian energy sources has focused people\u2019s minds on energy security,\u201d Rolls-Royce SMR spokesman Dan Gould said.An SMR\u2019s components can be built in a factory, moved to a site in tractor trailers and assembled there, making the technology more attractive to frugal buyers, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s like building Lego,\u201d Gould said. \u201cBuilding on a smaller scale reduces risks and makes it a more investible project.\u201dSome SMRs are essentially pressurized water reactors identical to some 400 reactors worldwide, while other designs use sodium, lead, gas or salt as a coolant instead of water. The key advantages are their size \u2014 about one-tenth as big as a standard reactor \u2014 the ease of construction and the price tag.The estimated cost of a Rolls-Royce SMR is 2.2 billion to 2.8 billion pounds ($2.5 billion to $3.2 billion), with an estimated construction time of 5 1/2 years. That\u2019s two years faster than it took to build a standard nuclear plant between 2016 and 2021, according to International Atomic Energy Agency statistics. Some estimates put the cost of building a 1,100-megawatt nuclear plant at between $6 billion and $9 billion.Rolls-Royce aims to build its first stations in the U.K. within 5 1/2 years, Gould said.Similarly, Oregon-based NuScale Power signed agreements last year with two Polish companies \u2014 copper and silver producer KGHM and energy producer UNIMOT \u2014 to explore the possibility of building SMRs to power heavy industry. Poland wants to switch from polluting, coal-powered electricity generation.Rolls-Royce SMR said last month that it signed a deal with Dutch development company ULC-Energy to look into setting up SMRs in the Netherlands.Another partner is Turkey, where Russia is building the Akkuyu nuclear power plant on the southern coast. Environmentalists say the region is seismically active and could be a target for terrorists.The introduction of \u201cunproven\u201d nuclear power technology in the form of SMRs doesn\u2019t sit well with environmentalists, who argue that proliferation of small reactors will exacerbate the problem of how to dispose of highly radioactive nuclear waste.\u201cUnfortunately, Turkey is governed by an incompetent administration that has turned it into a \u2018test bed\u2019 for corporations,\u201d said Koray Dogan Urbarli, a spokesman for Turkey\u2019s Green Party.\u201cIt is giving up the sovereignty of a certain region for at least 100 years for Russia to build a nuclear power plant. This incompetence and lobbying power make Turkey an easy target for SMRs,\u201d said Koray, adding that his party eschews technology with an \u201cuncertain future.\u201dGould said one Rolls-Royce SMR would generate nuclear waste the size of a \u201ctennis court piled 1-meter high\u201d throughout the plant\u2019s 60-year lifetime. He said initially, waste would be stored on site at the U.K. plants and would eventually be transferred to a long-term disposal site selected by the British government.M.V. Ramana, professor of public policy and global affairs at the University of British Columbia, cites research suggesting there\u2019s \u201cno demonstrated way\u201d to ensure nuclear waste stored in what authorities consider to be secure sites won\u2019t escape in the future.The constant heat generated by the waste could alter rock formations where it\u2019s stored and allow water seepage, while future mining activities could compromise a nuclear waste site\u2019s integrity, said Ramana, who specializes in international security and nuclear energy.Skeptics also raise the risks of possibly exporting such technology in politically tumultuous regions. Gould said Rolls-Royce is \u201ccompletely compliant\u201d with U.K. and international requirements in exporting its SMR technology \u201conly in territories that are signatories to the necessary international treaties for the peaceful use of nuclear power for energy generation.\u201dRamana said, however, there\u2019s no guarantee nations will follow the rules.\u201cAny country acquiring nuclear reactors automatically enhances its capacity to make nuclear weapons,\u201d he said, adding that every SMR could produce \u201caround 10 bombs worth of plutonium each year.\u201dRolls-Royce SMR could opt to stop supplying fuel and other services to anyone flouting the rules, but \u201cshould any country choose to do so, it can simply tell the International Atomic Energy Agency to stop inspections, as Iran has done, for example,\u201d Ramana said.Although spent fuel normally undergoes chemical reprocessing to generate the kind of plutonium used in nuclear weapons, Ramana said such reprocessing technology is widely known and that a very sophisticated reprocessing plant isn\u2019t required to produce the amount of plutonium needed for weapons.",

The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) has, reportedly, run out of propellant, making it difficult to be revived in the Red Planet\u2019s orbit.This development is fuelling speculation that the mission is finally over. The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), which operates the spacecraft around Mars, is yet to say anything on the matter of whether the probe can be revived or not.Sources told news agency PTI that there is no fuel left in Mangalyaan. \"Right now, there is no fuel left. The satellite battery has drained,\" sources in the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) told PTI, adding that the link has been lost.\u201cRecently there were back-to-back eclipses including one that lasted seven-and-half hours.

    "content": "The European Solar Orbiter, which recently survived a dangerous eruption from the Sun, while it was close to Venus, has solved a decades-long mystery of the origin of magnetic switchbacks. The findings point to their physical formation mechanism that might help accelerate the solar wind.The spacecraft has made the first ever observations of mysterious solar switchback the sudden and large deflections of the solar wind\u2019s magnetic field. It provides a full view of the structure, which appears to have an S-shaped character that had been predicted in the past.The orbiter also provides compelling data that indicates that these rapidly changing magnetic fields can have their origin near the surface of the Sun. The sudden change in the magnetic field around the Sun has been puzzling astronomers for decades, which was first seen in the 1970s when the German-US Helios 1 and 2 spacecraft flew close to the Sun.Also Read | China discovers new mineral on Moon, Xi approves lunar research baseThe reversals in the Sun's magnetic field was dynamic and could remain turned for just minutes or at times even hours before switching to the original direction. The European Space Agency noted that this phenomenon increased with the arrival of NASA\u2019s Parker Solar Probe in 2018, forcing astronomers to speculate that it was more numerous close to the Sun, and led to the suggestion that they were caused by S-shaped kinks in the magnetic field.The latest observation was made on March 25, 2022, when the Solar Orbiter was just a day away from a close pass of the Sun bringing it within the orbit of planet Mercury. The spacecraft had turned on its Metis instrument, which blocks out the bright glare of light from the Sun\u2019s surface and takes pictures of the Sun\u2019s outer atmosphere, known as the corona.Metis recorded an image of the solar corona that showed a distorted S-shaped kink in the coronal plasma, which looked like a switchback. Daniele Telloni of the National Institute for Astrophysics - Astrophysical Observatory of Torino compared the Metis image with a concurrent image taken by the Solar Orbiter\u2019s Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instrument.Also Read | Indian scientists unravel hidden process behind transition of cellsHe found that switchback was taking place above an active region catalogued as AR 12972, which is associated with sunspots and magnetic activity. Analysis revealed that the speed of the plasma above this region was very slow, as would be expected from an active region that has yet to release its stored energy.They found magnetic highways along which the plasma can flow freely, and give rise to the fast solar wind. The researchers proved that \"switchbacks occur when there is an interaction between a region of open magnetic field lines and a region of closed magnetic field lines. This releases energy and sets an S-shaped disturbance traveling off into space, which a passing spacecraft would record as a switchback.\"\u201cI would say that this first image of a magnetic switchback in the solar corona has revealed the mystery of their origin. The next step is to try to statistically link switchbacks observed in situ with their source regions on the Sun,\u201d says Daniele.The study has been published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.Also Read | Doomsday glacier, the size of Gujarat, on edge of disaster",

According to China's Global Times, the mineral was discovered by scientists from Beijing Research Institute of Uranium Geology, who isolated a single crystal particle with a radius of about 10 microns through high-tech means such as X-ray diffraction.Also Read | US: Transportation board to head probes of fatal space accidentsThe mineral was discovered from a sample of 140,000 lunar particles.Changesite-(Y) is the sixth mineral discovered on the Moon by humans, since the dawn of time and the beginning of lunar exploration. The mineral was found in samples retrieved from a region of the Moon, which is about 1 billion years younger than where the US and former Soviet Union retrieved samples.With the discovery of the new mineral, China is pushing fast its lunar program as the fourth phase of lunar missions has been approved by the Xi Jinping government.

So, the samples will be much more valuable,\" Liu Jizhong, director of Lunar Exploration and Space Program Center was quoted as saying by CGTN.The new phase will see China construct a research station on the Moon in the coming decade. Meanwhile, the Chang'e-7 spacecraft will be launched to the moon's South Pole, followed by Chang\u00e9-6, which will return the samples from the surface.China has plans to build a research station on the lunar surface and 2022 could see the mission pick up the pace. Beijing had completed the feasibility studies of the fourth phase of its lunar exploration program in 2021.

The statement holds relevance as Jaishankar, in a stern approach, urged Washington and Islamabad to introspect on the rationale behind the deal on one of the most advanced fighter jets.\"...Very honestly, it's a relationship that has neither ended up serving Pakistan well nor serving American interests.

The transition is essential for several biological phenomena such as cell division, cell mobility, transport of nutrients into cells, and viral infections.Changes in the geometry and topology of self-assembled membranes underlie diverse processes across cellular biology and engineering. The team of researchers have looked at colloidal membranes, which are micrometer-thick layers of aligned, rod-like particles.These membranes provide a more tractable system to study as they exhibit many of the same properties as cell membranes, and unlike a plastic sheet, where all the molecules are immobile, cell membranes are fluidic sheets in which each component is free to diffuse.Also Read | Doomsday glacier, the size of Gujarat, on edge of disasterThe study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences states that the experiment reveals the three-dimensional details of the pathway by which membranes undergo topological shape changes in real-time.The colloidal membranes were made by a solution of rod-shaped viruses of two different lengths: 1.2 micrometers and 0.88 micrometers. The team studied the shape of the colloidal membranes changes as one increases the fraction of short rods in the solution. \u201cI made multiple samples by mixing different volumes of the two viruses and then observed them under a microscope,\u201d explains Ayantika Khanra, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Physics and the first author of the paper.Over time, the membranes began merging and growing in size, and when the saddles merged laterally, they formed a bigger saddle of the same or higher order. IISc in a statement, however, said that r, when they merged at an almost right angle, away from their edges, the final configuration was a catenoid-like shape.The team wants to further the study and understand how other microscopic changes in the membrane components affect the large-scale properties of membranes.Also Read | Scientists discover unique protein Maia that could treat infertility",

    "content": "Antarctica's Thwaites glacier, roughly the size of the state of Gujarat, which could severely raise global sea levels, cause flooding in low-lying areas, and submerge coastal regions, is teetering closer to disaster. Researchers have found that the West Antarctic glacier is in a phase of fast retreat, raising concerns worldwide.Known as Doomsday Glacier, Thwaites glacier has been one of the worst hit by climate change and rising temperatures due to global warming. Scientists speculate that a total loss of the glacier and surrounding icy basins could raise sea level from three to ten feet.The study published in the journal Nature Geoscience states that understanding the recent history of Thwaites Glacier, and the processes controlling its ongoing retreat, is key to projecting Antarctic contributions to future sea-level rise. The analysis revealed that Thwaites is retreating at over 2.1 kilometers per year, which is \"twice the rate observed by satellite at the fastest retreating part of the grounding zone between 2011 and 2019.\"Scientists have mapped a critical area of the seafloor in front of the glacier that gives them a window into how fast Thwaites retreated and moved in the past. The imagery revealed geologic features that are new to science and also provides a kind of crystal ball to see into Thwaites\u2019 future.Also Read | Scientists warn ice-sheet collapse, coral die-off could happen anytime\u201cIt\u2019s as if you are looking at a tide gauge on the seafloor.

Our results suggest that pulses of very rapid retreat have occurred at Thwaites Glacier in the last two centuries, and possibly as recently as the mid-20th Century,\u201d said marine geophysicist Alastair Graham, the lead author of the paper.The team added that Thwaites is really holding on today by its fingernail and that some big changes must be over small timescales in the future even from one year to the next once the glacier retreats beyond a shallow ridge in its bed. The team now wants to sample the seabed sediments directly so they can more accurately date the ridge-like features.Thwaites is a floating ice shelf that acts as a dam to slow the flow of ice off the continent into the ocean. A previous study revealed that if this floating ice shelf breaks apart, the Thwaites Glacier will accelerate and its contribution to sea-level rise will increase by as much as 25 per cent.Also Read | Satellite images reveal the wrath of biblical floods in Pakistan | See PicsThe ice shelf, if and when it breaks, could lead to the creation of hundreds of icebergs and eventually collapse.Also Read | Scientists look inside water, end up solving 30-year-old mystery",

    "content": "Dispelling the empty rumors on the social media of an invisible coup d'etat in Beijing, Chinese president Xi Jinping made his first public appearance on Tuesday since returning to China in mid-September. The stage is now set for perhaps the most important political event in the recent history of China begging the question will Xi Jinping emerge stronger after the 20th National Party Congress (NPC) scheduled on October 16 later this year and will he declare a successor?Experts believe that Xi is more likely to cement his position even further in the political setup of China. China-watchers expect the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party to embark on his extraordinary third term without any hiccups. So, what is working in Xi\u2019s favour, why does he remain unchallenged and why it is virtually impossible even for the military to overthrow him in present-day China?According to China experts, the top Chinese political leader, through his sustained efforts, has made sure that his position becomes stronger through his direct and indirect hold over most decision-making bodies.READ | China President Xi Jinping reappears on state TV amid rumours over 'absence' \u201cUndoubtedly, Xi Jinping is going to embark on his third term with the 20th Party Congress. It remains no mystery given no successor has been declared and Xi has already amassed central authority in every capacity in China,\u201d said Dr Amrita Jash, Assistant Professor at the Department of Geopolitics and International Relations at the Manipal Academy of Higher Education and author of the book The Concept of Active Defence in China's Military Strategy.According to Dr Jash, among the principal factors working in Xi\u2019s favour is his success in consolidating his power as the supreme leader by means of enshrining \u201cXi Jinping thought\" to the Constitution, abolishing the presidential term limits and incorporating a powerful new government agency called the National Supervisory Commission into China\u2019s Constitution.\u201cXi Jinping has been strategically placing his loyalists in all important party and state positions,\u201d Suyash Desai, another keen China-watcher and Taiwan-based research scholar studying China\u2019s defence and foreign policies tells India Today.There is also a belief that Xi has created a political system where the wheels of power revolve around him.\u201cParty's key centres are immensely reliant on him personally, especially as he has spent the last five years ensuring complete control over functions of the government,\u201d Eerishika Pankaj, Head of Research and Operations Director at Organisation for Research on China and Asia (ORCA) in New Delhi tells India Today.In her opinion, by deemphasising the formal government bureaucracy, Xi has reconfigured the regime's policymaking environment, strengthening his power to steer a route that is advantageous to his personal and policy aims.ALSO READ | Social media abuzz with rumour of coup in Beijing against Xi Jinping\u201cXi has made significant changes to the procedure for choosing the delegates and senior leaders. Xi's emphasis on centralization and \u2018top-level design\u2019 is emphasised by these reforms, which undermine past conventions intended to promote greater balance and openness,\u201d she added.The People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), the principal military force in China, has undergone some structural reforms over the past few years, but Xi remains firmer at the very core of the PLA power structure. A recent report by Joel Wuthnow, a Washington-based National Defense University that analysed more than 300 biographies of senior Chinese military officers from 2015 and 2021 noted that there were few opportunities for \u201cfast burners\u201d to achieve quicker success in the PLA.\u201cSenior officers were homogenous in terms of age, education, gender, and ethnicity. Xi has not looked to a broader pool of talent to fill the senior ranks,\u201d Wuthnow notes in his study. He further assessed that all PLA officers were members of the CCP and must show enough political acumen to demonstrate loyalty to Xi and his agenda. Military officers are also rotated geographically to prevent patronage networks.As the Chairman of the party\u2019s Central Military Commission (CMC) and commander-in-chief of the PLA, Xi Jinping steers the PLA\u2019s every proceeding. \u201cThe PLA cannot exercise any form of self-motivated actions, therefore leaving no scope for the PLA to dismiss or overrule Xi\u2019s command,\u201d Dr Jash explains.She further cites the 2017 CMC circular which categorically stated that: \u201cthe army should be absolutely loyal, honest and reliable to Xi\" and asserted that \u201cthe army should follow Xi\u2019s command, answer to his order, and never worry him.\u201dThe revised Constitution specifically emphasises the \u201cimplementation of Xi Jinping\u2019s thinking\u201d on strengthening the PLA. Besides, Xi has also adopted the tactic of rapid promotions of PLA officers to gain loyalty.\u201cSince 2019, Xi has promoted 38 officers to the rank of full generals- giving only his loyalists the key posts,\u201d noted Dr Jash.According to Desai, the basic nature of the PLA itself separates it from most other militaries. \u201cUnlike most armed forces, the PLA is the party's army and not the state's army. So, the PLA is answerable to CCP chief and CMC Chairman, both positions occupied by Xi. The loyalty of the armed forces (the PLA) and paramilitary forces (PAP) makes Xi's position comfortable and his regime unchallengeable,\u201d Desai explains why the idea of a military coup against Xi could be a faraway thought.Experts also claim that Xi's control over central power structures of the party is now \u2018absolute\u2019 with the state council's powers under Xi and the ever-weakening situation of factional politics in China. Eerishika Pankaj emphasises that earlier, it was the council that delinked the party secretary and state president, which is now under Xi\u2019s command, with the creation of small leading groups, many of which Xi chairs himself.\u201cIn such a scenario, the power of Xi's faction -- termed the Xi Gang or Xi Clique --which emerged as a rival to Jiang Zemin's Shanghai Gang and the Chinese Communist Youth League (CCYL) headed by Hu Jintao is no longer under threat,\u201d said Pankaj.The Xi Gang, by default, now holds all major decision-making posts, negating the influential power of the other two factions, which are unable to balance their authority against it.Hu Chunhua\u2014touted as the next Premier replacing Li Keqiang, belongs to the Youth League faction; nonetheless, he still remains the most promising candidate, as he has been signaling loyalty to Xi. \u201cThe gradual weakening of the premier's power ensures that he would not emerge as a structural threat,\u201d Pankaj added.Since assuming power, a string of senior officials have been punished for corruption in crackdowns launched after President Xi Jinping took power in late 2012. Xi has been eliminating rival leaders under charges of corruption that has put some of China's highest-ranking officials either under prosecution or under investigation. The recent incidents of arrests and prosecution just before the October 16 political gala include the sentencing of a former Chinese justice minister and a former deputy police minister earlier this month.\u201cXi has been using the 'anti-corruption\u2019 campaign to catch the \u2018tigers\u2019 and the \u2018flies\u2019 of both civil and military- a mechanism to avert all forms of challenges to his political politics- in the party, state and the PLA,\u201d said Dr Jash. Xi has empowered and utilised the discipline inspection committees to keep tabs on rival factions.\u201cAn example of this was inclusion of discipline inspection officer in the Central Military Commission. Even if there is a little doubt on someone possibly challenging Xi, discipline inspection acts against it, and they are put behind bars. This makes challenging Xi a bit difficult,\u201d said Desai.Xi, according to Pankaj, has \u201corchestrated a methodical campaign of personalised exaltation of his position within the leadership by both removing opposition as part of his anti-corruption campaigns and installing key loyalists in powerful positions to protect his authority.\u201dALSO READ | Was there a massive cancellation of flights in China and empty airspace over Beijing?",

    "content": "Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday, September 27, reappeared on state TV when he visited an exhibition of the Communist Party. This was his first appearance in public life after his return from the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Samarkand on September 16, which sparked rumours about his absence from public events ahead of next month's key Congress of the ruling party.According to rumours on the Internet, Jinping had been removed as the chief of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army, or the PLA.Jinping on Tuesday called for \"concerted efforts to forge ahead determinedly toward a new victory of socialism with Chinese characteristics\". He was accompanied by No. 2 leader and Premier Li Keqiang and other top CPC officials.In his speech, Xi highlighted the CPC's and his country's achievements under his leadership over the past 10 years. \"The Party and the State have made historic achievements and undergone historic changes, providing a more perfect system, a more solid material foundation and more active spiritual power to achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,\" he said.\"We should widely publicise the strategic initiatives, transformative practices, breakthroughs and landmark achievements over the past 10 years, and publicise the milestone significance of the great changes in the last decade in the history of the Party, the history of a new China,\" he said.According to observers Jinping being absent from the public could have been due to the seven-day mandatory quarantine at a designated place rule. The quarantine is followed by a three-day homestay as per the official guidelines for those returning from abroad under China's dynamic Zero Covid policy.Two former ministers were sentenced to death and four officials were sent to life in jail this week in China. According to reports, the six were part of a 'political faction'. Currently, the Communist Party is running an anti-corruption campaign across the country and it is believed that the six were opponents of Jinping. The news of Jinping\u2019s house arrest is believed to have been started and spread by the anti-Jinping lobby.His absence sparked rumours of tensions within the the CPC, which is all set to hold its once-in-five-years Congress on October 16 in which 69-year-old Xi is widely expected to get endorsement for a record third term. Refuting the rumours and speculation, the CPC on Sunday announced that all delegates totalling nearly 2,300 were \"elected\" for the Congress under the guidelines set by Xi Jinping.A total of 2,296 delegates were \"elected\" to attend the upcoming 20th National Congress of the CPC to be held on October 16, the party said in a statement.",

    "content": "China on Tuesday angrily retorted at the US call to Pakistan to seek debt relief from its all-weather ally Beijing to deal with the grim flood situation, saying that instead of passing \"unwarranted criticism\" against Sino-Pak cooperation, Washington should do something beneficial to the Pakistani people.\"We send a simple message. We are here for Pakistan, just as we were during past natural disasters, looking ahead to rebuild,\" US Secretary Antony Blinken was quoted as saying after talks with Pakistan Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari in Washington.\"I also urged our colleagues to engage China on some of the important issues of debt relief and restructuring so that Pakistan can more quickly recover from the floods,\u201d Blinken said.As per the official data, more than 1,600 people have been killed and over 33 million affected due to the massive floods since mid-June, leaving the government at the mercy of international support.Reacting to Blinken\u2019s comments, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a media briefing here that since the floods hit the country, China has rushed to Pakistan's aid \"as its genuine friend and brother in times of need\" and provided 400 million RMB (USD 57 million) worth of humanitarian assistance.\"We will continue to do our utmost to help the Pakistani people overcome the floods and rebuild their homes at an early date,\" Wang said.\"China and Pakistan have had fruitful economic and financial cooperation. The Pakistani people know it best. Instead of passing unwarranted criticism against China-Pakistan cooperation, the US side might as well do something real and beneficial for the people of Pakistan,\" he said.The US too has announced USD 57 million in aid for Pakistan, according to media reports.In the last 10 years, China is reported to have invested over USD 28 billion in a host of projects under the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship scheme under President Xi Jinping\u2019s multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative.India has objected to China over the CPEC as it is being laid through Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK).After the floods hit Pakistan, Xi met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at Samarkand, Uzbekistan on September 16 on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa visited China and held talks with Chinese Defence Minister General Wei Fenghe on September 19.However, besides the USD 57 million in aid from the government and civil society organisations, China maintained steady silence on Pakistan\u2019s fervent appeals for financial assistance in view of the precarious financial situation.Beijing too didn't step in a big way during recent Sri Lanka\u2019s acute financial crisis belying Colombo\u2019s expectations of debt relief, though China has provided humanitarian assistance.Recent reports said trouble is brewing between the all-weather friends with China increasingly getting critical of Pakistan's failure in protecting Chinese workers who came under periodic attacks from the militant groups.In April, three Chinese were killed in a suicide blast in Karachi University carried out by the separatist Baloch Liberation Army, which is opposed to China's investments in Balochistan, accusing China and Pakistan of exploitation of the resource-rich region.Some of the other attacks were also attributed to radical Islamic militant outfits in Pakistan.With recurring attacks, China is reportedly pressing Pakistan to permit the Chinese agencies to provide security for their personnel which, according to press reports, Islamabad is resisting.Beijing is also concerned over the acute financial crisis faced by Pakistan, prompting it to step in periodically to bail it out with the induction of foreign exchange loans.According to Pakistan media reports, China is also concerned about the slow pace of progress of the CPEC projects. Chinese investors were also reportedly irked by Islamabad\u2019s failure to honour its contractual obligations under the CPEC framework.",

    "content": "A series of unusual leaks on two natural gas pipelines running from Russia under the Baltic Sea to Germany triggered concerns about possible sabotage Tuesday, overshadowing the inauguration of a long-awaited pipeline in Poland that will bring Norwegian gas to Europe in efforts to bolster energy independence from Moscow.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she \u201ccannot rule out\u201d sabotage after three leaks were detected over the past day on Nord Stream 1 and 2. The pipelines are not bringing gas to Europe as an energy standoff over Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine halted flows or never allowed them to begin. However, gas still fills the lines.Frederiksen joined Poland\u2019s President Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in opening a valve of a yellow pipe belonging to the Baltic Pipe, a new system that will bring Norway\u2019s gas across Denmark and the Baltic Sea to Poland.No official presented evidence of what caused the problems, but in central Europe where distrust of Russia runs high, there were fears Moscow sabotaged its own infrastructure in a gesture of spite or to signal that all pipelines are vulnerable to attack. The leaks emerged off the coast of Denmark and Sweden, raising the stakes on whether energy infrastructure in European waters was being targeted and leading to a small bump in natural gas prices.A Polish government official said he would not rule out the possibility of Russian \u201cprovocations.\u201d\u201cI cannot exclude any scenario. We are in a situation of high international tension,\u201d said Marcin Przydacz, a deputy foreign minister. \u201cUnfortunately, our eastern neighbor is pursuing an aggressive policy all the time.\u201dKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the leaks \u201cvery alarming.\u201d\u201cThis is an unprecedented situation that requires an urgent investigation. We are extremely worried by this news,\u201d he said in a conference call with reporters.Asked if the accident may have been caused by an act of sabotage, Peskov said that \u201cno version could be excluded.\u201dBecause the pipelines aren\u2019t actively sending gas to Europe, the leaks did not pose any threat to energy supplies, and experts said the environmental impact would be limited. With the continent needing gas to heat homes, generate electricity and run factories, the energy crisis provoked by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine threatens rationing, business shutdowns and possible recession this winter.It was \u201chighly unusual for gas leaks like this to happen,\u201d said Kristian Rune Poulsen, energy analyst at Green Power Denmark, But \u201cthe market has long been set on us not receiving Russian gas. Therefore, the gas leaks do not fundamentally change the situation.\u201dPolish energy expert Andrzej Sikora said he has been warning of the \u201cpossibility of attacks on the infrastructure\u201d since the construction of Nord Stream 1 in 2010. The significant drop in pressure caused by the leaks was clearly not the result of \u201ca bad weld,\u201d said Sikora, head of the Energy Studies Institute think tank.Danish authorities said Monday that a leak was detected in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which has never been used. They later announced a major pressure drop on the parallel Nord Stream 1, which until recently has been a key source of gas to Germany.The Swedish Maritime Administration said Tuesday that two leaks were discovered on Nord Stream 1, which partly runs in Swedish waters. Danish authorities also have confirmed the leaks.The Danish Maritime Authority issued a navigation warning and established a prohibited area to ensure that ships do not go near the leaks. Ships may lose buoyancy if they sail into the area, and there may also be a risk of ignition above the water and in the air, the Danish authorities said. Swedish authorities sent out similar warnings.The leaks in the pipelines have been detected northeast and southeast of the Danish island of Bornholm.The pipelines have been at the center of an energy war between Europe and Russia since the invasion of Ukraine in late February. A plunge in Russian gas supplies has caused energy prices to soar, pressuring governments to help ease the pain of sky-high gas and electric bills for households and businesses as winter nears.European countries have been struggling to find other sources of gas. Poland, for example, was already on track to free itself of Russian gas after working for years to find other sources, including imports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, from the United States and Middle East. Germany, in contrast, is only now racing to quickly build LNG terminals.Baltic Pipe is a prominent project in the bid for energy security and is to start bringing Norwegian gas through Denmark and along the Baltic Sea to Poland on Oct. 1.Sikora, the Polish energy analyst, has been urging steps to ensure the security of the Baltic Pipe, which at one point crosses paths with both Nord Stream pipelines.Despite Russia cutting off Nord Stream 1, gas storage has progressed in recent weeks in Germany and other parts of Europe.\u201cWe do not see any impact on the security of supply,\u201d the German economy ministry said, referring to the pressure drop in Nord Stream 1. \u201cStorage levels continue to rise steadily. They are currently at about 91%.\u201d",

It was linked with human life. With that soil, work was on the Kashi Bose Lane Mandap.One of the top organisers of this Puja committee, Soumen Dutta said, \"Soil is cultivated, food is produced.

Hasina is a persevering stateswoman determined to ensure that her country gets the 'developed' status. And surely, much to her unshakeable commitment and relentless struggles, Bangladesh is more poised to navigate a sea of hurdles ahead of the looming recession than many European nations.ALSO READ | Sheikh Hasina meets PM Modi, recalls India's contribution in Bangladesh liberation warThe awkwardly off-the-hook comparison with Sri Lanka further suffers a heavy blow as news outlets conveniently ignore the key factor about the country\u2019s food production capability, given that Sheikh Hasina, from the outset of her term in power, introduced heavy subsidies for farmers. Her persistent stress on maximising cultivable land and modernisation of farming led the country to earn sufficiency in food production, in contrast to Sri Lanka\u2019s misguided drive for organic agriculture that led to the sharp dip in food output.Here's a look into the trials and tribulations of Sheikh Hasina on her 75th birthday.Six years of exiled life following the assassination of her father 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, mother, brother and almost all family members, and nine long years of arduous battle against military dictator General Ershad\u2019s rule, known as the \u201cfight for people\u2019s right to vote\u201d, clearly put her above a lot of global leaders.For a country that topped the global corruption index under BNP-Jamaat rule for almost five years, reducing poverty, achieving gender parity in school education, and bringing down maternal mortality are some achievements that many other developing countries should take a cue from.Arrested without warrant by the military-backed caretaker government in 2007, daunting times in prison, smear campaigns carried out against her during that regime as later admitted by Mahfuz Anam, editor of the country\u2019s leading English daily, who confessed to producing unverified information fed by the country\u2019s prime intelligence agency DGFI, are surely exemplary for future leaders.Her indomitable courage: Keeping up the fight against a rabidly radical political ecosystem that includes Jamaat-e-Islami, even after braving at least 19 assassination attempts, Sheikh Hasina remains the best hope to rid Bangladesh of the menace of militancy. From initiating a war crimes trial to taking on radicals who staged 'Boycot French products' protests and calling for an end to girls\u2019 education to putting an end to the notoriety of the country as a safe haven for transnational terrorists, Sheikh Hasina is surely the biggest bulwark against those militants. Achieving such a feat in a Muslim majority country, once ruled by such elements, needs to be emulated.As Bangladesh passed 50 years of its independence in 2021, Sheikh Hasina\u2019s biggest success was how her policies turned around millions of lives. Under her watch, homes for the homeless \u2014 a scheme rolled out by her office \u2014 has paid dividends for thousands of lives with a target to end homelessness. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, her stimulus packages for the affected families and some cash incentives alongside food rationing helped lower-income groups survive unprecedented crises like lockdowns.Soon after the World Bank pulled out from funding the country\u2019s largest infrastructure undertaking, Sheikh Hasina went ahead with a move to self-fund the Padma Bridge project that connected Bangladesh\u2019s once isolated southern part with the capital. Unlike Sri Lanka\u2019s Hambantota port, which attracted hardly any shipping after being built at a huge cost, the bridge on the river Padma earned millions soon after it was opened to traffic.",

    "content": "Hurricane Ian tore into western Cuba on Tuesday as a major hurricane, with nothing to stop it from intensifying into a catastrophic Category 4 storm before it hits Florida on Wednesday.Ian made landfall at 4:30 a.m. EDT Tuesday in Cuba\u2019s Pinar del Rio province, where officials set up 55 shelters, evacuated 50,000 people, rushed in emergency personnel and took steps to protect crops in Cuba\u2019s main tobacco-growing region.The U.S. National Hurricane Center said \u201csignificant wind and storm surge impacts\u201d were occurring Tuesday morning in western Cuba. Ian had sustained top winds of 125 mph (205 kmh) as it moved over the city of Pinar del Rio. As much as 14 feet (4.3 meters) of storm surge was predicted along Cuba\u2019s coast.Ian was forecast to strengthen even more over warm Gulf of Mexico waters, reaching top winds of 140 mph (225 kmh) before making landfall again. Tropical storm-force winds were expected in Florida late Tuesday, reaching hurricane force Wednesday morning.Also Read | Hurricane Fiona submerges Puerto Rico deeper, troops rescue hundredsThe hurricane center said there\u2019s a 100 percent chance of damaging tropical storm force winds and water along Florida\u2019s west coast, and expanded its hurricane warning, from Bonita Beach north through Tampa Bay to the Anclote River.Tampa and St. Petersburg could get their first direct hit by a major hurricane since 1921.\u201cPlease treat this storm seriously. It\u2019s the real deal. This is not a drill,\u201d Hillsborough County Emergency Management Director Timothy Dudley said Monday at a news conference on storm preparations in Tampa.Ian\u2019s forward movement was expected to slow over the gulf, enabling the hurricane to grow wider and stronger before it brings punishing wind and water to Florida\u2019s west coast. Forecasters said the surge of ocean water could reach 10 feet (3 meters) if it peaks at high tide. Rainfall could total 16 inches (41 centimeters) inches with as much as 24 inches (61 centimeters) in isolated areas. Coastal communities could be inundated.As many as 300,000 people may be evacuated from low-lying areas in Hillsborough County alone, county administrator Bonnie Wise said. Some of those evacuations were beginning Monday afternoon in the most vulnerable areas, with schools and other locations opening as shelters.\u201cWe must do everything we can to protect our residents. Time is of the essence,\u201d Wise said.Lee County -- where Fort Myers is on Florida\u2019s southwest Gulf Coast -- also issued mandatory evacuations early Tuesday for low-lying areas including Fort Myers Beach, Sanibel and Bonita Beach, where about 250,000 people live, after forecasters expanded the hurricane warning area.Also Read | Hurricane Fiona pounds Bermuda as Canada braces for major jolt\u201cPeople on the barrier islands who decide not to go, they do so at their own peril,\u201d Roger Desjarlais, Lee County\u2019s county manager, said early Tuesday. \u201cThe best thing they can do is leave. With the kind of tidal surge we\u2019re talking about, it would not be uncommon for both islands to be overwashed, and it\u2019s a dangerous place to be. We cannot by law force people off the islands, but we strongly recommend that they go.\u201dFloridians lined up for hours in Tampa to collect bags of sand and cleared store shelves of bottled water. Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a statewide emergency and warned that Ian could lash large areas of the state, knocking out power and interrupting fuel supplies.\u201cYou have a significant storm that may end up being a Category 4 hurricane,\u201d DeSantis said at a news conference Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s going to cause a huge amount of storm surge. You\u2019re going to have flood events. You\u2019re going to have a lot of different impacts.\u201dDeSantis said the state has suspended tolls around the Tampa Bay area and mobilized 5,000 Florida state national guard troops, with another 2,000 on standby in neighboring states.President Joe Biden also declared an emergency, authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief and provide assistance to protect lives and property. The president postponed a scheduled Tuesday trip to Florida because of the storm.Playing it safe, NASA was rolling its moon rocket from the launch pad to its Kennedy Space Center hangar, adding weeks of delay to the test flight.

    "content": "Workload management has been the buzzword in international cricket ever since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. With players increasingly getting fatigued due to the schedule and restrictions due to the pandemic, players and team management have begun prioritising workload management more than ever.However, in the lead-up to the T20 World Cup in Australia, several teams are missing key players, with a few racing against time to get fit for the premier T20 showpiece, starting October 16 in Australia.A back injury concern to Jasprit Bumrah, India's premier fast bowler, has dominated the headlines in the last few days after he was ruled out of an ongoing 3-match T20I series against South Africa at home. With only.2 weeks left for the World Cup, India are sweating on Jasprit Bumrah's fitness even as speculation is rife that the Mumbai Indians pacer might not be ready in time for their opening match against arch-rivals Pakistan at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on October 23.Head coach Rahul Dravid played down concerns, saying that the team management is hopeful of having Bumrah for the T20 World Cup in Australia.Legendary Australian bowler Brett Lee, speaking to Indiatoday.in, on Sunday, said Jasprit Bumrah's availability will be key to India's chances at the T20 World Cup. Lee highlighted that Bumrah's unmatched ability to nail yorkers at the death will be crucial to determining whether India win the World Cup or settle for a top 4 finish.\"That (speculation) can go a long way but I think if they have to win, they have to win with Bumrah. He is the key, in my opinion. I hope he gets back as soon as possible. I really hope that the injury can heal itself quickly. He will get the best treatment, best management,\" Lee, who is in India for Legends League Cricket, said.\"He is a terrific fellow, a world-class bowler. His yorkers at the death will be the difference between India going far and India winning the World Cup,\" he added.Questions have been asked of India's workload management in the T20 World Cup year as a few players have spent time on the sidelines due to recurring injuries. India suffered a massive blow when all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja was ruled out of the T20 World Cup but his replacement Axar Patel has stepped up with the ball.On the other hand, India are concerned about Jasprit Bumrah's availability as there are, it is safe to say, no ideal replacements for the Mumbai Indians star. Bumrah recovered from an injury concern that kept him out of the Asia Cup and returned to action during the 3-match series against Australia in September. However, a recurrence of the back issue seems to be affecting India's plans for the T20 World Cup as he was ruled out of the South Africa series after being included in the squad, initially.Stressing that it's important to not mix workload management with mismanagement, Brett Lee said it doesn't always mean that bowling less leads to fewer injuries, especially in the case of fast bowlers.\"Well, I think, putting things into context, bowling less doesn\u2019t mean fewer injuries. I think it can mean more injuries, sometimes. Bowling more could also mean more injuries, sometimes. Workload sometimes gets muddled up with bad action and mismanagement.\"We have got to be careful when we say \u2018if you don\u2019t want a bowler to get injured, don\u2019t bowl him too much\u2019. I think it\u2019s the other way around, I have always said the more you bowl, your body always gets used to the workload, and gets used to strength build-up.\"If batters hit fewer balls, then they are worse off. If you look at the greats, the tennis players, they hit ball after ball. If you think about Tiger Woods in Golf, he hits millions and millions and millions of balls. As a batter, you have to hit a volume of balls. As a bowler, you have to bowl volume of balls, as simple as that,\" Lee said.",

Nonetheless, Facebook said it was the largest and most complex Russian propaganda effort that it has found since the invasion began.The operation involved more than 60 websites created to mimic legitimate news sites including The Guardian newspaper in the United Kingdom and Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel. Instead of the actual news reported by those outlets, however, the fake sites contained links to Russian propaganda and disinformation about Ukraine. More than 1,600 fake Facebook accounts were used to spread the propaganda to audiences in Germany, Italy, France, the U.K. and Ukraine.READ | Russians flee to Georgia after Putin's mobilisation orderThe findings highlighted both the promise of social media companies to police their sites and the peril that disinformation continues to pose.\u201cVideo: False Staging in Bucha Revealed!\u201d claimed one of the fake news stories, which blamed Ukraine for the slaughter of hundreds of Ukrainians in a town occupied by the Russians.The fake social media accounts were then used to spread links to the fake news stories and other pro-Russian posts and videos on Facebook and Instagram, as well as platforms including Telegram and Twitter. The network was active throughout the summer.\u201cOn a few occasions, the operation\u2019s content was amplified by the official Facebook pages of Russian embassies in Europe and Asia,\u201d said David Agranovich, Meta\u2019s director of threat disruption. \u201cI think this is probably the largest and most complex Russian-origin operation that we\u2019ve disrupted since the beginning of the war in Ukraine earlier this year.\u201dALSO READ | Anger, protests and violence in Russia as Putin calls thousands of reservists to fight UkraineThe network\u2019s activities were first noticed by investigative reporters in Germany. When Meta began its investigation it found that many of the fake accounts had already been removed by Facebook\u2019s automated systems. Thousands of people were following the network\u2019s Facebook pages when they were deactivated earlier this year.Researchers said they couldn\u2019t directly attribute the network to the Russian government. But Agranovich noted the role played by Russian diplomats and said the operation relied on some sophisticated tactics, including the use of multiple languages and carefully constructed imposter websites.Since the war began in February, the Kremlin has used online disinformation and conspiracy theories in an effort to weaken international support for Ukraine. Groups linked to the Russian government have accused Ukraine of staging attacks, blamed the war on baseless allegations of U.S. bioweapon development and portrayed Ukrainian refugees as criminals and rapists.Social media platforms and European governments have tried to stifle the Kremlin\u2019s propaganda and disinformation, only to see Russia shift tactics.A message sent to the Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., asking for a response to Meta\u2019s recent actions was not immediately returned.ALSO READ | Mark Zuckerberg hints at lay offs at Meta in future, feels there are many employees doing nothingResearchers at Meta Platforms Inc., which is based in Menlo Park, California, also exposed a much smaller network that originated in China and attempted to spread divisive political content in the U.S.The operation reached only a tiny U.S. audience, with some posts receiving just a single engagement. The posts also made some amateurish moves that showed they weren\u2019t American, including some clumsy English language mistakes and a habit of posting during Chinese working hours.Despite its ineffectiveness, the network is notable because it\u2019s the first identified by Meta that targeted Americans with political messages ahead of this year\u2019s midterm elections. The Chinese posts didn\u2019t support one party or the other but seemed intent on stirring up polarization.\u201cWhile it failed, it\u2019s important because it\u2019s a new direction\u201d for Chinese disinformation operations, said Ben Nimmo, who directs global threat intelligence for Meta.",

    "content": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States will vote this month on major issues of space debris as more and more satellites reach Low Earth Orbit, congesting the already tightened space above Earth. The organisation will aim to introduce new rules to address the growing risks of orbital debris.The Low Earth Orbit is normally at an altitude of less than 1000 kilometers but could be as low as 160 kilometers above Earth.The new FCC rules could reduce the timeframe that is required to maintain satellites in orbit once their missions are complete, after which they have to re-enter into Earth's atmosphere for a fiery demise. The new rules will be an update to the 2004 regulations calling for satellite post-mission disposal as soon as practicable but no more than five years.Also Read | Europe unveils hi-tech satellite to speed up extreme weather warningsThe American agency currently regulates operators of satellites in LEO to ensure spacecraft will re-enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere within 25 years following the completion of missions.Reuters reported that the new rules would apply to both US-licensed satellites and systems, and non-US satellites seeking US market access. \"Defunct satellites, discarded rocket cores, and other debris now fill the space environment, creating challenges for future missions,\" the agency noted, adding that there were 4,800 satellites currently operating in orbit.\"As the number of objects in space increases, so too does the probability of collisions. At risk is more than the $279 billion-a-year satellite and launch industries and the jobs that depend on them,\" the agency warned, adding that it also endangers satellite connectivity that is critical to modern life, including broadband in remote areas, navigation, and video.FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel had earlier said that \"the new space age needs new rules and that they must make sure that the rules are prepared for the proliferation of satellites in orbit and new activities at our higher altitudes.Also Read | WATCH | SpaceX fires all engines on Starship rocket prototype\"When disaster strikes, satellites help organize first responders, the government, and humanitarian organizations and make it possible to coordinate effective relief efforts. Left unchecked, orbital debris could block all of these benefits and reduce opportunities across nearly every sector of our economy,\" the FCC noted.With small satellites and constellations being launched by companies like SpaceX, OneWeb and others, there is a growing demand from global countries to enhance space monitoring and tracking in order to safeguard space assets from collisions in Low Earth Orbit.Also Read | Take 3: Nasa to re-attempt launching Artemis-1 to Moon, but it won't be easy",

The new discovery could also pave the way for the development of better contraceptives.The protein has been named Maia, the Greek goddess of motherhood.The research conducted by an international team led by Kateina Komrskov\u00e1 from the Institute of Biotechnology of the Czech Academy of Sciences found that also highlights the development of cell cultures for the \u201cproduction\u201d of human oocyte proteins.The study published in the journal Science Advances states that gamete fusion is a critical event of mammalian fertilization and the team discovered a new Fc receptor-like protein 3 on the human egg that binds to a key sperm protein. The interaction of the protein and adhesion leads to human sperm-egg fusion and the creation of life.\u201cThis is the result of nearly two decades of research and of extensive international collaboration the publication includes 17 different affiliations from around the world, including the UK, the US, and Japan,\u201d Komrskova said in a statement. The study initially began in Harry Moore\u2019s lab at the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom.The team was using the One-Bead One-Compound (OBOC) assay method to look for mutations that cause tumours, during which interacting partners bind to special beads, and began looking for receptors on the surface of the egg cell, which are key factors in sperm interaction and which are still unknown to science.\"We created hundreds of thousands of different beads, each with a segment of protein on its surface. We incubated these beads with human sperm and isolated those that interacted with each other. After a number of experiments, we were able to identify a candidate fusion protein,\" Komrskova explained.The team had to negotiate their way through several challenges including how to obtain ethical committee approval for the research first since the protein can only be found in humans. The approval took over two years to use human eggs and sperm for the research.Also Read | Scientists look inside water, end up solving 30-year-old mystery\u201cWe also developed special cell cultures that mimicked the egg. These cells were then capable of \u2018producing\u2019 proteins that are normally found on the surface of a human egg, which made it possible for us to conduct a range of experiments,\" the lead researcher added.They were able to spot microvilli on the surface of the human egg, covered by the signal that belonged to the protein they discovered.They are hopeful that the discovery of the protein could lead to the improvement of infertility treatment methods as well as the development of future contraceptives.\"Fertilisation is a crucial moment in human life, yet there is a lot we still do not know about it. Such new findings that contribute to the understanding of physiological processes can find direct application in human medicine,\u201d Komrskova concluded.Also Read | Long Covid linked to suicide: Scientists warn of hidden crisis",

    "content": "From floods in Pakistan to wildfires in the United States to droughts across China, the effects of climate change have become more frequent and severely intense as the world looks on. A new study warns that five climate tipping points could happen sooner than expected.Published in the journal Science, researchers warned that these changes may lead to abrupt, irreversible, and dangerous impacts with serious implications for humanity. It is worth mentioning that climate tipping points are conditions beyond which changes in a part of the climate system become self-perpetuating and potentially irreversible.Researchers have been monitoring 16 climate tipping points, the environmental threshold beyond which the global climate system could spiral toward a dangerous state, for over a decade and have found that while most are not possible at current temperatures, a few could happen sooner than expected.Also Read | Satellite images reveal the wrath of biblical floods in Pakistan | See PicsCLIMATE TIPPING AHEADResearchers warned that with only a few more tenths of a degree of warming from now, at 1.5 degrees Celsius, warming since pre-industrial times, five climate tipping points will enter the threshold zone. These five tipping points include:* Irreversible collapse of the Greenland ice sheet* Irreversible collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet* Immediate loss of tropical coral reefs around the globe* Collapse of the Labrador-Irminger Seas convection* Thawing of high northern permafrost that releases massive amounts of greenhouse gases\"We can see some potential early warning signals. The Greenland Ice Sheet is showing signs of destabilization with lots of melt and there are potentially early warnings that the Atlantic circulation might be slowing down,\" climate scientist David Armstrong McKay, a coauthor of the study said.Earlier this year, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that the risk of triggering climate tipping points becomes high at around 2C of warming.Also Read | As Africa\u2019s climate warms, rich countries pledge more fundsWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?While ice sheets with several meters or yards of potential sea rise can reshape the coastline over centuries, the loss of coral reefs could have major consequences on human life since millions of people, especially poorer tropical area residents, depend on fisheries linked to the coral reefs.When it comes to the timing of the consequences, while the ice sheet collapse could be triggered soon their impact will take some time to play out as compared to the loss of coral reefs, which will have consequences within the decade.\u201cIt\u2019s a future generation issue. That ice sheets collapsing is kind of that thousand-year timescale, but it\u2019s still bequeathing an entirely different planet to our descendants,\u201d McKay added, while study co-author Tim Lenton, an Earth systems scientist at the University of Exeter prayed that they are not right.\u201cThere\u2019s a distinct chance some of these tipping points are going to be unavoidable. And therefore it\u2019s really important we do some more thinking about how we\u2019re going to adapt to the consequences,\u201d Lenton told the Associated Press.The analysis by the international team of researchers indicates that even global warming of 1 degree Celsius, a threshold that we already have passed, puts us at risk by triggering some tipping points.Also Read | Bengaluru flooded: Why is it raining so heavily in Karnataka?",

    "content": "Russian men are fleeing into neighbouring Georgia to avoid being called-up to fight in a war they do not agree with following Russian President Vladimir Putin's order to mobilise hundreds of thousands of reservists for the conflict in Ukraine.At one point on Sunday, the estimated wait to enter Georgia hit 48 hours, with more than 3,000 vehicles queuing to cross the frontier, Russian state media reported, citing local officials.The Georgian capital Tbilisi had already seen an influx of around 40,000 Russians since Moscow invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, according to government statistics.ALSO READ | Anger, protests and violence in Russia as Putin calls thousands of reservists to fight Ukraine\"When we found out about the mobilisation, we dropped everything at home and jumped in the car,\" Dmitry Kuriliyunok told Reuters in Tbilisi.Dmitry, his wife Irina and young daughter first drove across southern Russia from Krasnodar to Mineralnye Vody in the North Caucasus, a staging post for many crossing into Georgia. There, they hired a local driver to take them through the border checkpoints and after 24 hours they arrived in Tbilisi.\"We are completely against this war. For us, like for others, it's scary. To die and to kill others, and for what? We don't understand. Therefore, we decided to flee,\" he said.The exact number of people who have left Russia since Putin announced what he called a \"partial mobilisation\" last Wednesday is unclear. But an early picture is emerging of a substantial exodus.Scenes such as those at the Russia-Georgia border have also taken place at crossings with Kazakhstan, Finland and Mongolia, which have all reported heavy queues. Russia has not closed its borders, and guards generally appeared to be letting people leave.Flights departing Moscow for the few countries that maintain direct flights with Russia have either sold out or have only a handful of tickets available at astronomical prices.Russians already in Tbilisi saw Putin's mobilisation decree as further vindication of their decisions to flee.\"I came to Tbilisi about a month and a half ago because I didn't support the military invasion of Ukraine,\" said Ivan Streltsov, a reservist in Russia's armed forces who could have been forcibly drafted had he been in Russia.\"I took part in protests when the military operation started. For us as activists things have become very difficult at this moment. In our own motherland, we are all being watched,\" he said.More than 200 men who were detained at anti-war protests in Moscow last week were issued draft summons, state media reported.But the wave of new arrivals to Tbilisi also threatens to reignite simmering anti-Russian sentiment within Georgia - both among local people and the Russian emigrees already in the capital.ALSO READ | 'War has come to our homes': Flights sold-out as Putin orders partial military call-upBuildings, shops, museums and parks across Tbilisi are still plastered with Ukrainian flags and pro-Kyiv messages, and graffiti telling Russians to \"go home\" or lambasting Putin is a common sight.Local people resent the economic impact of tens of thousands of new arrivals on a city of just over one million, with apartment prices having rocketed over the last six months.Some Russians, too, feel a sense of angst about the latest influx.\"They've been to protests (against mobilisation), but for the first seven months of this war, everything was normal and fine for them,\" said Stas Gaivoronsky, a writer who owns a second-hand bookshop in Tbilisi.\"But now they've been caught up in it and are out protesting the war,\" he said.ALSO READ | Not bluffing on nukes, says Putin, orders partial mobilisation of Russian citizens",

The agency said that once the repairs are complete, engineers will reconnect the plates and perform initial tests to evaluate the new seals.\"Teams will check the new seals under cryogenic, or supercold, conditions no earlier than Sept. 17 in which the rocket\u2019s core stage and interim cryogenic propulsion stage will be loaded with liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen to validate the repair under the conditions it would experience on launch day,\" Nasa said in a blog update.Also Read | Nasa gives $200 million contract to Axiom to make spacesuits for moonwalksA series of hydrogen fuel leaks and other problems halted back-to-back launch attempts last week.Nasa said that a two-hour launch window will open on September 23 at 4:17 pm IST and if the launch happens the spacecraft will be on a 42-day long voyage going 60,000 kilometers beyond the Moon and returning.

    "content": "Veteran stock investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala passed away at the age of 62 on Sunday morning. Just a week earlier, Jhunjhunwala often fondly referred to as India\u2019s Warren Buffett after the stock market Oracle of Omaha was celebrating the launch of the maiden flight of the country\u2019s newest airline, Akasa Air on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad sector.Although wheelchair-bound, Jhunjhunwala, in his inimitable style, had quipped that even before the airline was launched, it forced competitors to take notice of the product. In a short address at the event, he told the Akasa management and staff that as the low-cost carrier expanded its operation, they need to be frugal without compromising on either passenger comfort or the quality of the product.Following his sudden demise on Sunday morning, Jhunjhunwala\u2019s words would be resonating in the minds of Akasa CEO Vinay Dube and others on his team. It is not every day that marquee investors like to risk their money on a low-yield-high investment business like aviation.\u201cWe cannot thank Mr Jhunjhunwala enough for being an early believer in us and putting his trust and faith in us to build a world-class airline Akasa Air will honour Mr Jhunjhunwala\u2019s legacy, values and belief in us by striving to run a great airline,\u201d said Dube in a statement.Jhunjhunawala had invested $35 million in the LCC for an over 40 per cent stake. It was not only one of his last major investments, but something very close to his heart. Passengers on the carrier\u2019s first flight remember how a usually restrained Jhunjhunwala freely mixed with them for conversations and selfies.\u201cWhile his charisma, advice and fund pulling abilities will be missed, he has ensured that the company is professionally run and will survive and prosper in his absence,\u201d observed the head of retail research at HDFC Securities, Deepak Jasani. \u201cThis venture denotes his confidence and faith about the growth potential of the industry given the demography of India and rising aspirations of its bulging middle class.\u201dALSO READ | All about legendary investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, who believed risk is the essence of lifeOther market observers chose to be cautious and said that Jhunjhunwala\u2019s passing away may put a temporary pause on Akasa\u2019s ambitions.\u201cHe [Jhunjhunwala] was critical in providing financial capital to the company. The management could potentially explore the option of finding another investor, though it remains to be seen who would be willing to invest such large amounts of money in the airline with the path to profitability yet to be established,\u201d a senior research analyst tracking aviation told India Today, requesting anonymity.\u201cAlternately, Akasa can also evaluate potential tie-ups with global airlines wanting to invest in India\u2019s aviation sector,\u201d he added.A senior executive with an Indian carrier said, \u201cJhunjhunwala was critical to Akasa as he was not only an investor in the company but also could arrange cheap financing for them from both Indian banks and foreign institutional investors. His enormous clout in the market also made him a scarecrow to a behemoth like IndiGo.\u201d\u201cWith him gone, Akasa will be under tremendous stress and may turn out to be a different animal than what was originally envisaged. Also, IndiGo may be a lot more ruthless in dealing with it on sectors where it launches operations,\u201d said the senior airline executive.However, in his lifetime, Jhunjhunwala was seldom known to make losing bets. So, any speculation on the LCC\u2019s fate may yet prove to be unfounded in the long term.(With input from Manish Pant)",

Why does it freeze at some temperatures and vapourise at others?Researchers at the University of Birmingham and Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma have unraveled a unique water property, which was first proposed three decades ago. It can change and turn into two different liquids in what is called a phase transition. However, it happens at extremely cold temperatures.But, doesn't water turn solid into ice at low temperatures?Yes, it does, and that's what remained the biggest challenge in confirming the theory that had been baffling scientists for nearly 30 years. They maintained that because of the hidden chemical workings inside water, the reason why it happens still remains mostly unknown about the liquid-liquid transition.The findings of the study have been published in the journal Nature Physics, which states that a salient feature of liquid water is the anomalous behaviour of its thermodynamic response functions upon cooling, the most famous being the maximum density at ambient pressure.Also Read | Mysterious region on Sun where temperatures drops if you go close capturedFrancesco Sciortino, now a professor at Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma and a co-author of the study was part of the original team, which in 1992 proposed the idea of a liquid-liquid phase transition in water. \"In this work, we propose, for the first time, a view of the liquid-liquid phase transition based on network entanglement ideas. I am sure this work will inspire novel theoretical modelling based on topological concepts,\u201d he said in a statement.While the high-density liquid form has molecules arranged in such a way that they resemble a pretzel, they are entangled, while the molecules in the low-density form mostly have rings and are therefore dubbed untangled.The researchers, according to the University of Birmingham, used a colloidal model of water in their simulation, and then two widely used molecular models of water. Colloids are particles that can be a thousand times larger than a single water molecule. By virtue of their relatively bigger size, and hence slower movements.\u201cThis colloidal model of water provides a magnifying glass into molecular water, and enables us to unravel the secrets of water concerning the tale of two liquids,\u201d Dr. Dwaipayan Chakrabarti, lead author of the paper, said in a statement.Also Read | Energy crisis in Europe to hit Cern, Large Hadron Collider likely to shut science opsThe research aims to look inside water and find the movements and chemistry happening at the molecular level, which could be further analysed and explored.\"Water, one after the other, reveals its secrets!

He reportedly sustained minor injuries and was detained by police.As troubling as these incidents are, it is the spread of protests to far-flung strongholds of Putin\u2019s base of support that could be more concerning for the Kremlin, with women confronting authorities about \u201ctaking our sons.\u201d Although the mobilization was said to total about 300,000 men, some media reports claim the authorities plan to muster more than 1 million, which Moscow denied.Even though initial demonstrations against the mobilization were brutally suppressed by police, with hundreds detained shortly after it was announced, more have broken out in various regions.

His son was rescued.The dead recovered so far included 28 women and 18 children, said Jahurul Islam, chief administrator of the northern district of Panchagarh, where the accident occurred.\"Divers are searching for more bodies as some are still missing,\" he said, adding that the ferry had been taking Hindu devotees to a temple on the occasion of Mahalaya, when Hindus make offerings to their ancestors.The death toll was the worst for a maritime disaster in the country since 2015, when at least 78 people died after an overcrowded ferry collided with a cargo vessel in a river west of the capital, Dhaka.A five-member committee was investigating Sunday's sinking but initial reports suggested the boat was carrying almost three times its capacity, Islam said.Police said that, while some of the passengers managed to swim ashore or were rescued, about 10 were still missing. Passengers said more than 80 people had been on board.Dozens of people die each year in ferry accidents in Bangladesh, a low-lying country that has extensive inland waterways and lax safety standards.READ | Boat capsizes in Ganga in UP's Ghazipur, 5 bodies of children recovered",

    "content": "Former Australia all-rounder Shane Watson wants India opener, KL Rahul, to approach the T20 World Cup later this month with a nothing to lose mentality because that is how he bats best.Rahul's strike rate has come under scrutiny during the Asia Cup and the ongoing home T20I series against South Africa. Though India had to chase down only 107 in the opening T20 against South Africa, concerns were raised concerning Rahul's intent as he concluded with 51 not out off 56 balls.Rahul, according to Watson, must take the aggressive approach from the first ball of the T20 World Cup in Australia.\"KL Rahul is one of my favourite batters. To me when he is batting at his best, when he is aggressive, he takes the game on and is not trying to control the game. He has got that skill, when he is just reacting to the ball coming down, he has all the shots all around the ground against the best bowlers in the world,\" Watson was quoted as saying by PTI.\"I love seeing him when he feels like he's got nothing to lose, then he can even strike at 180 without taking too much risk. If he is able to do that (in Australia), there will be a lot of bowlers in trouble,\" said one of the best all-rounders to have played for Australia.Watson wants Mohammad Siraj to take Bumrah's place if the latter is deemed unfit for the World Cup.\"India have certainly got the batting to do incredibly well in Australian conditions but the biggest question mark is around their fast bowling.\"The spinners, Axar Patel and Yuzi Chahal, are as good as anyone in the world in all conditions but fast bowling without Bumrah in particular, whether they can execute skills under pressure at the back end of the game. That is where teams will be trying to expose India.\"India need a bowler who can bowl in excess of 140kmph in the absence of Bumrah, said Watson.\"It is a genuine concern (lack of express pace), that is why Siraj will be a good option if Bumrah isn't there.\"The pace at which he bowls and the skills he has got, swinging it away and pushing towards 150 kmph with the brand new ball and he can execute well in the end as well.\"He provides that element that other Indian bowlers don't necessarily have,\" said the 41-year-old, adding that he would pick Siraj over Mohammad Shami in the squad.",

It\u2019s the real deal. This is not a drill,\u201d Hillsborough County Emergency Management Director Timothy Dudley said at a news conference on storm preparations in Tampa.ALSO READ | Something we have never seen before: Florida braces for Hurricane Ian's impactAuthorities in Cuba were evacuating 50,000 people in Pinar del Rio province, sent in medical and emergency personnel, and took steps to protect food and other crops in warehouses, according to state media.\u201cCuba is expecting extreme hurricane-force winds, also life-threatening storm surge and heavy rainfall,\u201d U.S. National Hurricane Center senior specialist Daniel Brown told The Associated Press.The hurricane center predicted areas of Cuba\u2019s western coast could see as much as 14 feet (4.3 meters) of storm surge Monday night or early Tuesday.In Havana, fishermen were taking their boats out of the water along the famous Malecon, the seaside boardwalk, and city workers were unclogging storm drains ahead of the expected rain.Havana resident Adyz Ladron, 35, said the potential for rising water from the storm worries him.\u201cI am very scared because my house gets completely flooded, with water up to here,\u201d he said, pointing to his chest.In Havana\u2019s El Fanguito, a poor neighborhood near the Almendares River, residents were packing up what they could to leave their homes, many of which show damage from previous storms.\u201cI hope we escape this one because it would be the end of us. We already have so little,\u201d health worker Abel Rodrigues, 54, said.ALSO WATCH | Hurricane Fiona looks angry from space On Monday night, Ian was moving northwest at 13 mph (20 km/h), about 105 miles (169 kilometers) southeast of the western tip of Cuba, with top sustained winds increasing to 105 mph (169 km/h).The center of the hurricane passed to the west of the Cayman Islands, but no major damage was reported there Monday, and residents were going back into the streets as the winds died down.\u201cWe seem to have dodged the bullet\u201d Grand Cayman resident Gary Hollins said. \u201cI am a happy camper.\u201dIan won\u2019t linger over Cuba but will slow down over the Gulf of Mexico, growing wider and stronger, \u201cwhich will have the potential to produce significant wind and storm surge impacts along the west coast of Florida,\u201d the hurricane center said.A surge of up to 10 feet (3 meters) of ocean water and 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was predicted across the Tampa Bay area, with as much as 15 inches (38 centimeters) inches in isolated areas. That\u2019s enough water to inundate coastal communities.As many as 300,000 people may be evacuated from low-lying areas in Hillsborough County alone, county administrator Bonnie Wise said. Some of those evacuations were beginning Monday afternoon in the most vulnerable areas, with schools and other locations opening as shelters.\u201cWe must do everything we can to protect our residents. Time is of the essence,\u201d Wise said.Floridians lined up for hours in Tampa to collect bags of sand and cleared store shelves of bottled water. Gov.

You\u2019re going to have flood events. You\u2019re going to have a lot of different impacts.\u201dDeSantis said the state has suspended tolls around the Tampa Bay area and mobilized 5,000 Florida state national guard troops, with another 2,000 on standby in neighboring states.President Joe Biden also declared an emergency, authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief and provide assistance to protect lives and property.

    "content": "Ravichandran Ashwin has taken a sly dig at the English media for how they have handled the Deepti Sharma-Charlotte Dean run-out controversy by saying that they have been playing the victim card after the incident.The incident from last week's third ODI between England and India has been in the headlines for the past few days with opinion being divided around the globe. Harsha Bhogle had launched an attack on the English media for trying to vilify the Indian all-rounder for her actions. Ashwin has now commented on the issue.Speaking on his YouTube channel, as quoted by NDTV, Ashwin said that many have started raising questions as to why the innocent person is being questioned here and said that only a certain section of people have an issue with this. He said that they always try to play the victim card and whenever there is a change at first there will be resistance.\"In the beginning, the whole world saw it that way. But now, most of them have started realising that the bowlers didn't commit any crime there. Many of them have started asking why you are asking questions to the innocent instead of asking the person who should be guilty. Only a certain section of the people seems to have a problem with this.\"\"In my opinion, they always play the victim card. But whenever there is something new happening, there will be some resistance to change by a few people and that is understandable,\" said Ashwin.The India spinner continued by saying that a non-striker should know that they can be run-out if they step out of the crease. He also said that kids should be taught this right from start before the certain people try to instill their narratives on the topic. He said that he actually sees the incident as a bowler's revolution.\"Yes, I am talking about the run-out at the non-striker's end done by Deepti Sharma dismissing Charlie Dean. I have already spoken enough on this subject already. So let me be short and sweet today. Risk vs Reward. Just like how a batter knows when he steps out of the crease against a spinner or a pacer that a wicketkeeper can dismiss them by stumping. Likewise, a non-striker should also know that he can be dismissed run-out legitimately if they keep stepping out of the crease and taking that extra yard.\"\"We should teach the kids right from when they are young on this. Because in today's world of competitive cricket, I spoke about this during the Ahmedabad Test match when the pitch issue' was brought up on what was a good pitch. I told 'do not control the narratives'. Because a certain section of people consciously chooses to instill in others how they should think about a certain thing. They control their narratives. There are many articles on this exact subject. In fact, I see this as a bowler's revolution,\" said Ashwin.",

Net migration to Britain totalled 239,000 in the year to June 2021, according to the most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics.Braverman also said she wanted to restrict the ability of migrants to challenge deportation on the basis that they had been subjected to forced labour or human trafficking, known in Britain as \"modern slavery\".",

    "content": "European countries on Tuesday scrambled to investigate unexplained leaks in two Russian gas pipelines running under the Baltic Sea near Sweden and Denmark, infrastructure at the heart of an energy crisis since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Sweden's Maritime Authority issued a warning about two leaks in the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, shortly after a leak on the nearby Nord Stream 2 pipeline was discovered that had prompted Denmark to restrict shipping in a five nautical mile radius.Both pipelines have been flashpoints in an escalating energy war between Europe and Moscow that has pummelled major Western economies and sent gas prices soaring.Neither pipeline was pumping gas to Europe at the time leaks were found amid the dispute over the Ukraine war, but both still contained gas under pressure. The incidents will hinder any effort to start or restart either pipeline for commercial operations.\"Yesterday, a leak was detected on one of the two gas pipelines between Russia and Denmark - Nord Stream 2. The pipeline is not in operation, but contains natural gas, which is now leaking,\" Denmark's energy minister Dan Jorgensen said in a written comment.\"Authorities have now been informed that there have been 2 more leaks on Nord Stream 1, which is also not in operation but contains gas,\" he added.Gazprom declined comment.Russia slashed gas supplies to Europe via Nord Stream 1 before suspending flows altogether in August, blaming Western sanctions for causing technical difficulties. European politicians say that was a pretext to stop gas supplies.The new Nord Stream 2 pipeline had just been completed but had not entered commercial operations. The plan to supply gas via the pipeline was scrapped by Germany days before Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February.\"There are two leaks on Nord Stream 1 - one in the Swedish economic zone and one in the Danish economic zone. They are very near each other,\" a Swedish Maritime Administration (SMA) spokesperson told Reuters.The leaks were located northeast of the Danish island of Bornholm, the spokesperson said. It was not immediately clear what had caused the leaks.\"We are keeping extra watch to make sure no ship comes too close to the site,\" a second SMA spokesperson said.The Baltic Pipe, a new subsea pipeline delivering Norwegian gas to Poland with an annual capacity of 10 billion cubic metres per day, is due to be inaugurated later on Tuesday.Danish authorities have asked that the country's level of preparedness for the power and gas sector be raised after the leaks.\"Breaches of gas pipelines happen extremely rarely ... We want to ensure thorough monitoring of Denmark's critical infrastructure in order to strengthen security of supply in the future,\" said the head of the Danish energy agency, Kristoffer Bottzauw.The raised level would mean that companies in the power and gas sector have to implement measures to increase safety at, for example, plants, buildings and installations.Vessels can lose buoyancy if they enter the area, and there may be a risk of an ignition over the water and in the air, said the Danish energy agency, adding there were no security risks associated with the leak outside the exclusion zone.It said the gas leak would only affect the environment locally, which means that only the area where the gas plume in the water column is located would be affected.There would be a climate-damaging effect from the methane gas escaping into the air, it said in a written comment.READ | 'Putin cornered, might go nuclear': Ex-CIA official on Russia-Ukraine war",

It should be a united voice. It is not enough if we are together only in a few states. We should stand united in all States. We should be an all-India force.\"Addressing the CPI's Kerala State conference's session on federalism and Centre-State relations, Stalin recalled the dismissal of elected Left and DMK governments, decades ago, in Kerala and Tamil Nadu respectively, by the Centre invoking Article 356 of the Constitution.Stalin asserted: \"There is a need for review and re-appraisal of the Constitution. Until the Indian Constitution is amended to be truly federal, from the current status of quasi-federal, we shall not stop. We must continue to raise our voice and work towards our goal.\" The Tamil Nadu chief minister claimed that the Concurrent List is completely becoming the Union List.\"The powers of the state governments are being re-routed and financial rights were taken away from the states through the GST. Entrance tests like the NEET denied educational rights and the National Education Policy 2020 is an obstructive policy. The NEP is being opposed by his party and government not only because it was designed as a \"saffronisation and Hindi imposition policy,\" but also for preventing states from providing educational opportunities in tune with their policies.ALSO READ| 'Fake patriotism': MK Stalin hits out at BJP over slipper attack on TN ministerOn his Twitter handle, the DMK chief said: \"Amid excessive centralisation of powers by Union BJP Govt, the demand for a review & reappraisal of our constitution in order to make it truly federal becomes more important.

They are also in danger.\"Taking potshots at the BJP-led Centre over proposals like \"one nation-one election,\" he said uniformity is not unity. The answer to such autocratic tendencies is autonomy for states and a strong federal structure, he said.\"India is not a single government. It is a Union of many states. Calling India as a Union is not wrong. Even the Constitution defines India as a Union. After I started using the term, some viewed it as anti-national. They cannot even digest a term in the Constitution,\" he added.The friendship between the Dravidian and Left movements flowered from the days of the genesis of the two movements, the Dravidian party chief said.

It will be defeated in future too,\" he said.\"BJP should not misunderstand its electoral success as the success of its ideology. This is my polite reminder to them.

The move will affect science in a big way, especially the European Center for Nuclear Research, also known as the CERN.The collider is drafting plans to shut down some of its particle accelerators as the energy supply is affected. Officials said that a plan is being readied which will be presented during the forthcoming meeting to the CERN Council to reduce energy consumption and that the Large Hadron Collider may have to be temporarily shut.\"Our concern is really grid stability because we do all we can to prevent a blackout in our region. CERN wants to keep the LHC one of eight accelerators at the complex operating and avoid a sudden shutdown that could disrupt it,\" Serge Claudet, chair of CERN's energy management panel told the Wall Street Journal.The LHC is a 27-kilometer circular tunnel in which two proton beams are accelerated in opposite directions before they collide.

In the mid-seas it received the destination so it reached at its course, went to New York,\" Patra said at an event to celebrate 75 years of India's independence.The US embassy in New Delhi said it had no immediate comment.Patra's comments are India's first official public reference to such U.S. concerns. Delhi has not joined the sanctions against Russia or condemned what Moscow calls a \"special military operation\" in its neighbour.Patra said he was told the Russian crude was processed and converted into a distillate used for making single-use plastic. He did not identify the Indian vessel or refiner.\"So that's the way war works. It works in strange ways,\" he said.India, the world's number 3 oil importer and consumer rarely bought Russian oil in the past. But since the war started, Indian refiners have been snapping up discounted Russian oil, shunned by many Western countries and companies.",

    "content": "Scott Taylor never got to move on from Covid-19.The 56-year-old, who caught the disease in spring 2020, still had not recovered about 18 months later when he killed himself at his home near Dallas, having lost his health, memory and money.\"No one cares. No one wants to take the time to listen,\" Taylor wrote in a final text to a friend, speaking of the plight of millions of sufferers of long Covid, a disabling condition that can last for months and years after the initial infection.\"I can hardly do laundry without complete exhaustion, pain, fatigue, pain all up and down my spine. World spinning dizzily, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. It seems I say stuff and have no idea of what I'm saying,\" Taylor added.Long Covid is a complex medical condition that can be hard to diagnose as it has a range of more than 200 symptoms - some of which can resemble other illnesses - from exhaustion and cognitive impairment to pain, fever and heart palpitations, according to the World Health Organization.There is no authoritative data on the frequency of suicides among sufferers. Several scientists from organizations including the U.S. National Institutes of Health and Britain's data-collection agency are beginning to study a potential link following evidence of increased cases of depression and suicidal thoughts among people with long Covid, as well as a growing number of known deaths.\"I'm sure long Covid is associated with suicidal thoughts, with suicide attempts, with suicide plans and the risk of suicide death. We just don't have epidemiological data,\" said Leo Sher, a psychiatrist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York who studies mood disorders and suicidal behavior.Also Read | Mumbai logs 285 new Covid cases, zero deaths in last 24 hoursAmong key questions now being examined by researchers: does the risk of suicide potentially increase among patients because the virus is changing brain biology? Or does the loss of their ability to function as they once did push people to the brink, as can happen with other long-term health conditions?Sher said pain disorders in general were a very strong of predictor of suicide, as was inflammation in the brain, which several studies have linked with long Covid.\"We should take this seriously,\" he added.An analysis for Reuters conducted by Seattle-based health data firm Truveta showed that patients with long Covid were nearly twice as likely to receive a first-time antidepressant prescription within 90 days of their initial Covid diagnosis compared with people diagnosed with Covid alone.The analysis was based on data from 20 major U.S. hospital systems, including more than 1.3 million adults with a Covid diagnosis and 19,000 with a long Covid diagnosis between May 2020 and July 2022.The potential long-term effects of Covid-19 are poorly understood, with governments and scientists only now starting to systematically study the area as they emerge from a pandemic that itself blindsided much of the world.While many long Covid patients recover over time, around 15% still experience symptoms after 12 months, according to the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). There's no proven treatment and debilitating symptoms can leave sufferers unable to work.The implications of long Covid potentially being linked with increased risk of mental illness and suicide are grave; in America alone, the condition has affected up to 23 million people, the U.S. Government Accountability Office estimated in March.Also Read | UK approves second 'bivalent' booster for Omicron, original COVID strainLong Covid has also pushed roughly 4.5 million out of work, equal to about 2.4% of the U.S. workforce, employment expert Katie Bach of the Brookings Institution told Congress in July.Worldwide, nearly 150 million people are estimated to have developed long Covid during the first two years of the pandemic, according to the IHME.In many developing countries, a lack of surveillance of long Covid makes the picture even murkier, said Murad Khan, a psychiatry professor at Aga Khan University in Karachi, Pakistan, who is part of an international group of experts researching the suicide risk linked to Covid-19.\"We have a huge problem, but we don't know the extent of the problem,\" he said.Time is a scarce commodity for a growing number of long Covid sufferers who say they are running out of hope and money, according to Reuters interviews with several dozen patients, family members and disease experts.For Taylor, who lost his job selling genomic tests to physicians in a round of layoffs in the summer of 2020, the breaking point came when his insurance coverage through his former employer was due to expire and his application for social security benefits was denied, his family said.\"It was the straw that broke the camel's back,\" his older brother Mark Taylor said.Heidi Ferrer, a 50-year-old TV screenwriter originally from Kansas, killed herself in May 2021 to escape the tremors and excruciating pain that left her unable to walk or sleep after contracting Covid more than a year earlier, her husband Nick Guthe said.Guthe, a filmmaker who has become an advocate for long Covid sufferers since his wife's death, said that until this past winter, he had not heard of other suicides within the network of long Covid patients.\"They're now coming on a weekly basis,\" he added.Survivor Corps, an advocacy group for long Covid patients, said it polled their membership in May and found that 44% of nearly 200 respondents said they had considered suicide.Lauren Nichols, a board member at the long Covid support group Body Politic, said that through contact with family members on social media she was aware of more than 50 people with long Covid who had killed themselves, though Reuters was unable to independently confirm the cases.Nichols, 34, a logistics expert for the U.S. Department of Transportation in Boston, says she herself has considered suicide several times because of long Covid, which she has suffered for more than two years.Exit International advises English-speakers on how to seek help with assisted dying in Switzerland, where euthanasia is legal with certain checks. Fiona Stewart, a director, said the organization, which does not track outcomes after providing advice, had received several dozen inquiries from long Covid patients during the pandemic and was now getting about one a week.Also Read | Researchers' viral claim on Covid vaccine causing miscarriages has experts rushing to debunkThe U.S. National Institutes of Health is tracking mental health impacts as part of its $470 million RECOVER study into long Covid. Early results on anxiety and depression rates are expected by early September, but information on suicide will take longer, said Dr. Stuart Katz, a lead researcher.\"What we do know is that persons with chronic illnesses are susceptible to suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts and suicide completion,\" said Richard Gallagher, an associate professor of child psychiatry at NYU Langone Health, who is part of RECOVER.On the question of whether the virus changes the brain, Gallagher said there was some evidence that Covid can cause brain inflammation - which has been linked to suicide and depression - even among people who had relatively mild disease.\"There may be direct, in some ways, toxic effects of the virus, and part of it will be inflammation,\" he said.Long Covid on average reduces overall health by 21% - similar to total deafness or a traumatic brain injury, the University of Washington's IHME found.Although some experts expected Omicron to be less likely to cause long Covid, official UK data released this month found that 34% of the 2 million long Covid sufferers in the country developed their symptoms after an Omicron infection.A British government advisory group is studying the suicide risk for long Covid patients compared with the wider population while the state Office for National Statistics (ONS) is investigating whether it can assess upfront a long Covid patient's risk of suicide as it does for people with other diseases, such as cancer.\"Health conditions that are disabling long-term may add to suicide risk, hence the concern over long Covid,\" said Louis Appleby, a psychiatry professor at the University of Manchester and a UK government adviser.Indeed, research in Britain and Spain found a six-fold increased risk of suicide among patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), another post-viral illness with similar symptoms to long Covid, when compared with the general population.Also Read | China to resume issuing visas to Indian students after over 2 yearsBritain's network of long Covid treatment centers is also drastically oversubscribed, adding to a sense of hopelessness for some; in June, the latest month on record, only a third of patients received an appointment within six weeks of being referred by their local doctor, and another third had to wait for more than 15 weeks.Ruth Oshikanlu, a former midwife and health visitor in London turned pregnancy coach, said her long Covid health problems combined to push her close to the edge. When her business temporarily folded due to debt issues after she struggled to work, she felt her life was over.\"I was crying to the accountant, and the guy kept me on hold - I think he didn't want to be the last person to talk to me,\" the 48-year-old recalled.\"What Covid gives you is a lot of time to think,\" she said. \"I didn't think of ending it, thankfully, because of my son. But I do know so many people who have had those suicidal thoughts.\"Also Read | How much virus does a Covid-positive person exhale?",

    "content": "Israel has acquired a previously unknown ancient papyrus bearing a Hebrew inscription dated to around 2,700 years ago that had long been in possession of a Montana resident, the country\u2019s antiquities authority said Wednesday.The scrap of papyrus \u2014 scarcely larger than a postage stamp with four lines of angular script \u2014 is one of just a few from the region in the Late Iron Age, archaeologists said. The Israel Antiquities Authority said it authenticated its age using radiocarbon dating, which corresponded with the age of the text\u2019s writing style.Joe Uziel, director of the Judean desert scrolls unit, said the matching radiocarbon date and paleographic style makes him \u201cvery certain\u201d that it is not a modern forgery.The papyrus, which bears the Biblical name Ishmael, was likely looted sometime in the last century from a cave in the Judean Desert, he said.Also Read | World's oldest amputation: Skeleton reveals leg was surgically cut 31,000 yrs agoIts provenance and journey from the desert to Montana six decades ago and now to Jerusalem remain nebulous.The antiquities authority declined to name the Montana resident but said the man\u2019s mother obtained the artifact during a visit to what was then Jordanian-occupied east Jerusalem in 1965 and brought it to the United States.Jordanian law that was in force at the time severely restricted the sale of antiquities and prohibited the export of artifacts without a permit from the minister of antiquities. It wasn\u2019t clear whether the woman possessed such authorization.Numerous scroll fragments from the arid region near the Dead Sea that have emerged on the antiquities market in recent years, including several at Washington\u2019s Museum of the Bible, have proven to be forgeries.The antiquities authority showed the papyrus to the press at its labs in Jerusalem alongside two other ancient Hebrew fragments it holds \u2014 one found in a cave near the Dead Sea in the 1950s and a second that was seized from the antiquities black market in 2016 and believed to have been looted from a cave.Also Read | Venus hit again: 2nd eruption from Sun hammers Earth's mysterious twinEitan Klein, head of the Israeli antiquities\u2019 theft prevention unit, said the Montana man\u2019s mother may have either purchased the object from Khalil Iskander Shahin \u2014 a Bethlehem-based antiquities dealer better known as \u201cKando,\u201d who traded in many of the originally discovered Dead Sea Scrolls \u2014 or may have been given the papyrus by the curator of the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem.How Shahin or the curator, both of whom have since died, obtained the papyrus remains uncertain.The unidentified Montana man inherited the papyrus after his mother\u2019s death. An Israeli academic noticed a photo of this previously undocumented text in a colleague\u2019s unpublished papers and notified Klein, who tracked down the owner, the antiquities authority said.Klein said the man was invited to Jerusalem in 2019 and the sides came to an unspecified \u201carrangement\u201d whereby the papyrus was given to the Israeli authorities.Also Read | Indians consumed over 500 crore antibiotic tablets in a year, Azithromycin tops the table",

    "content": "Archeologists have found evidence of the world's oldest amputational surgery in a man from 31,000 years ago. The skeleton of a young adult, found in a cave in Indonesia, is missing its left foot, and part of it revealed the oldest known evidence of an amputation.Analysis revealed that the amputation was performed when the person was a child \u2014 and that the \u201cpatient\u201d went on to live for years as an amputee. The first evidence of this pre-historical surgery reveals a unique fact about early humans, they were advancing in medicine way before we expected.The study published in the journal Nature states that the evolution of medicine was from the emergence of settled agricultural societies around 10,000years ago, which gave rise to a host of health problems that had previously been unknown among non-sedentary foraging populations, stimulating the first major innovations in prehistoric medical practices.The skeleton, excavated from a cave in Borneo, in a rainforest region, was intact. The only deformity it had was a missing left foot and the lower part of its left leg. Analysis revealed that the foot bones weren\u2019t missing from the grave, or lost in an accident \u2014 they were carefully removed.Researchers said that the individual survived the procedure and lived for another 69years before his remains were intentionally buried in Liang Tebo cave. The remaining leg bone showed a clean, slanted cut that healed over and there were no signs of infection, which would be expected if the child had gotten its leg bitten off by a creature like a crocodile.Also Read | Indians consumed over 500 crore antibiotic tablets in a year, Azithromycin tops the table\"This unexpectedly early evidence of a successful limb amputation suggests that at least some modern human foraging groups in tropical Asia had developed sophisticated medical knowledge and skills long before the Neolithic farming transition,\" the paper read.While researchers don\u2019t know what kind of tool was used to amputate the limb, or how the infection was prevented \u2014 but they speculate that a sharp stone tool may have made the cut, and point out that some of the rich plant life in the region has medicinal properties.Before this find, the earliest example of amputation had been in a French farmer from 7,000 years ago, who had part of his forearm removed. Scientists had thought that advanced medical practices developed around 10,000 years ago, as humans settled down into agricultural societies, the study authors said.Also Read | The science of seatbelts and airbags in your cars",

    "content": "After traveling in the vacuum of space for nearly nine months, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission is ready for impact. The spacecraft, on a mission to test a technology that could be used to deflect an asteroid coming towards Earth in the future, will crash into Dimorphos, a moonlet of the asteroid Didymos.On its way, the spacecraft has finally spotted its destination as Nasa has scheduled the intentional crash into the asteroid, which does not pose a threat to Earth, on September 26. The mission is to test the world's first kinetic impact technique.The spacecraft used the Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for Optical navigation (DRACO) in July to snap 243 images of the dark space ahead of itself and form a composite, which shows asteroid Didymos and its orbiting moonlet Dimorphous. At the time, the spacecraft was 20 million miles away from the Didymos system.While engineers were unsure if the spacecraft will be able to see its destination from that distance, the composite image revealed Didymos in the darkness of space and pinpointed its location.\u201cThis first set of images is being used as a test to prove our imaging techniques. The quality of the image is similar to what we could obtain from ground-based telescopes, but it is important to show that DRACO is working properly and can see its target to make any adjustments needed before we begin using the images to guide the spacecraft into the asteroid autonomously,\u201d Elena Adams, the DART mission systems engineer said in a statement.Also Read | Explained: Why is Nasa intentionally crashing Dart spacecraftThe images are significant since the spacecraft will depend on this ability to see and process images of Didymos and Dimorphos, once it too can be seen, to guide the spacecraft toward the asteroid, especially in the final four hours before impact.\u201cSeeing the DRACO images of Didymos for the first time, we can iron out the best settings for DRACO and fine-tune the software. In September, we\u2019ll refine where DART is aiming by getting a more precise determination of Didymos\u2019 location,\u201d Julie Bellerose, the DART navigation lead, said in a statement.The Double Asteroid Redirection Test or Dart mission, is the demonstration of kinetic impactor technology, hitting an asteroid to adjust its speed and path. DART will be the first-ever space mission to demonstrate asteroid deflection by a kinetic impactor. The data from the crash can help scientists create mini-impacts in a lab and build sophisticated computer models based on those results.Also Read | Venus hit again: 2nd eruption from Sun hammers Earth's mysterious twin",

A massive eruption on the far side of the Sun hammered Venus for the second time within a week as activity on the star intensifies at a new pace.Nasa's STEREO-A spacecraft observed the massive eruption from the far side, which, while directed away from Earth, was directly in the way of Venus, which was bombarded heavily with radiation. According to spaceweather.com, it was a full halo coronal mass ejection from the far side of the Sun emerging during the late hours of September 5.A coronal mass ejection is one of the biggest eruptions from the Sun's surface that can contain a billion tons of matter accelerated to several million miles per hour into space. The particles and radiation tend to disturb the space environment and are at times deadly for electronics and satellites, killing them instantly.A model of the ejection developed by Nasa showed it heading away from Earth and directly toward Venus, hurtling a significant solar storm on Earth's mysterious twin.

It is part of the bond that forms the alliance.\"Russia's ambassador to Japan, Mikhail Galuzin, also attended.Some 20,000 police were deployed, nearby roads were closed and even some schools shut as Japan sought to avoid the security blunders that led to Abe's shooting with a homemade gun by a suspect who, police say, accused the Unification Church of impoverishing his family. read moreALSO READ | Japanese man sets himself on fire near PM\u2019s office to oppose Shinzo Abe\u2019s state funeralThe state funeral for Abe, who received a private funeral days after his assassination, was the first for an ex-premier since one in 1967 for former Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida.Kishida has explained the decision as a way of honouring Abe's achievements, as well as standing up for democracy, but ordinary Japanese remain divided. Only 30% of respondents in a recent poll by TV Asahi agreed with hosting the funeral, against 54% opposed.Even without the recent revelations about the Unification Church, it would be hard to imagine any circumstances where a majority of Japanese would favour honouring Abe with a state funeral, said Tobias Harris, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and the author of a biography of the former premier.\"He was someone who almost welcomed and invited controversy and saw his mission as overturning a longstanding consensus or set of consensuses\" about how Japan was run, Harris said.Many Japanese were \"attached to the postwar regime that he wanted to overturn\", Harris said.",

    "content": "As debate springs over prescribing Dolo-650 during the Covid-19 pandemic, a new study raises concerns pointing out the excessive use of antibiotics by Indians. Researchers found that India consumed over 500 crore antibiotics in 2019, of which Azithromycin was the most consumed antibiotic molecule.The study aims to establish the need for new regulations and strengthen existing ones to monitor and regulate the sale and use of antibiotics.Published in the journal Lancet Regional Health Southeast Asia, it states that the inappropriate use of antibiotics is a significant driver of antibiotic resistance in India. The research identifies unrestricted over-the-counter sales of most antibiotics complicate the availability and sale of medicine.\"Even though India is the largest antibiotic consumer in absolute volume, the country does not have a formal system of antibiotic use surveillance to guide an antimicrobial stewardship program akin to those found in the US and Europe,\" researchers said in the paper adding that the latest global surveillance report from 65 countries \u2014 that examined the antibiotic consumption for the year 2015 \u2014 did not have data from India.According to the US-based Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), antibiotics are medicines that fight infections caused by bacteria in humans and animals by either killing the bacteria or making it difficult for them to grow and multiply.Also Read | The science of seatbelts and airbags in your carsThe researchers from the Department of Epidemiology, Boston University School of Public Health, and Public Health Foundation of India analysed data from PharmaTrac, a private-sector drug sales dataset gathered from a panel of 9000 stockists across the country.

    "content": "Johnson & Johnson will stop selling talc-based baby powder globally in 2023, the drugmaker said on Thursday, more than two years after it ended US sales of a product that drew thousands of consumer safety lawsuits.\"As part of a worldwide portfolio assessment, we have made the commercial decision to transition to an all cornstarch-based baby powder portfolio,\" it said, adding that cornstarch-based baby powder is already sold in countries around the world.In 2020, J&J announced that it would stop selling its talc Baby Powder in the United States and Canada because demand had fallen in the wake of what it called \"misinformation\" about the product's safety amid a barrage of legal challenges.The company faces about 38,000 lawsuits from consumers and their survivors claiming its talc products caused cancer due to contamination with asbestos, a known carcinogen.J&J denies the allegations, saying decades of scientific testing and regulatory approvals have shown its talc to be safe and asbestos-free. On Thursday, it reiterated the statement as it announced the discontinuation of the product.J&J spun off subsidiary LTL Management in October, assigned its talc claims to it and immediately placed it into bankruptcy, pausing the pending lawsuits. Those suing have said Johnson & Johnson should have to defend itself against the lawsuits, while defendants of J&J and the bankrupt subsidiary process say it is an equitable way to compensate claimants.Ben Whiting, an attorney with the plaintiffs firm Keller Postman, said because the lawsuits are paused in bankruptcy, the company\u2019s sales decision won\u2019t immediately impact them. But if a federal appellate court allows the cases to move forward, the consumers could try to use Johnson & Johnson\u2019s decision to pull the products as evidence, Whiting said.\u201cIf these cases were to go again, then it\u2019s a very big deal,\u201d Whiting said.Before the bankruptcy filing, the company faced costs from $3.5 billion in verdicts and settlements, including one in which 22 women were awarded a judgment of more than $2 billion, according to bankruptcy court records.A shareholder proposal calling for an end to global sales of the talc baby powder failed in April.A 2018 Reuters investigation found that J&J knew for decades that asbestos, a carcinogen, was present in its talc products. Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence showed that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, J&J's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos.In response to evidence of asbestos contamination presented in media reports, in the court room and on Capitol Hill, J&J has repeatedly said its talc products are safe, and do not cause cancer.Sold since 1894, Johnson's Baby Powder became a symbol of the company's family-friendly image. An internal J&J marketing presentation from 1999 refers to the baby products division, with Baby Powder at the core, as J&J's \"#1 Asset\", Reuters reported, although the baby powder accounted for only about 0.5% of its U.S. consumer health business when the company pulled it off the shelves.",

    "content": "Iran faced more international criticism on Monday over the death of a woman in police custody that triggered nationwide protests after Tehran accused the United States of using the unrest to try to destabilise the country.Iran has cracked down on the biggest demonstrations since 2019, sparked by the death of 22-year-old Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini on Sept. 16 after she was detained by morality police enforcing the Islamic Republic's strict restrictions on women's dress. The case has drawn widespread condemnation.But the measures have not stopped Iranians from calling for the fall of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the rest of the clerical establishment.Canada will impose sanctions on those responsible for the death of Amini, including Iran's morality police unit and its leadership, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday.\"We've seen Iran disregarding human rights time and time again, now we see it with the death of Mahsa Amini and the crackdown on protests,\" Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa.Activist Twitter account 1500tasvir posted videos it said showed street protests late on Monday in different parts of Tehran, and footage where residents could be heard shouting \"Death to Khamenei\" from their homes. Reuters could not verify the videos.Women have played a prominent role in the protests, waving and burning their veils.Human rights group Hengaw posted a video which it said showed protesters cheering in Sanandaj, capital of Kurdistan province, as women took off their headscarves to protest forced hijab. In a later video, heavy shooting could be heard as streets appeared to be filled with tear gas.Another video posted on social media purported to show security forces opening fire late on Monday during protests in Sardasht, a town with a large Kurdish population. Reuters could not verify the videos.Iran said the United States was supporting rioters and seeking to destabilise the Islamic Republic.\"Washington is always trying to weaken Iran's stability and security although it has been unsuccessful,\" Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said in a statement.On his Instagram page, Kanaani accused the leaders of the United States and some European countries of abusing a tragic incident in support of \"rioters\" and ignoring \"the presence of millions of people in the streets and squares of the country in support of the system\".Also on Monday, Germany summoned the Iranian ambassador in Berlin to urge Tehran to stop its crackdown and allow peaceful protests. Asked about the possibility of further sanctions on Tehran in response to the violence, a German foreign ministry spokesperson had earlier said, \"We will consider all options\" with other European Union states. read moreLast week, the United States imposed sanctions on Iran's morality police over allegations of abuse of Iranian women, saying it held the unit responsible for the death of Amini.Students from the Dentistry Faculty of the University of Tabriz, with the exception of the emergency department, took part in a strike on Monday and refused to participate in classes, said the activist Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA).The strikes were conducted to protest against widespread arrests of students and forceful encounters with security forces in Iranian universities, it said.On Sunday, Iran summoned the British and Norwegian ambassadors over what it called interference and hostile media coverage of the unrest.The anti-government protests are the largest to sweep Iran since demonstrations over fuel prices in 2019, when Reuters reported 1,500 people were killed in a crackdown on protesters - the bloodiest bout of internal unrest in the Islamic Republic's history.At least 41 people have been killed since Sept. 17, according to state TV.President Ebrahim Raisi has said Iran ensures freedom of expression and that he has ordered an investigation into Amini's death.A leading Iranian teachers' union, in a statement posted on social media on Sunday, called for teachers and students to stage the first national strike since the unrest began, on Monday and Wednesday.In a video circulating on social media, the sister of a man killed in the anti-government demonstrations, Javad Heydari, cut her hair on his grave in defiance of Iran's Islamic dress code. Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the video.The state has organised rallies to try to defuse the crisis.Although the demonstrations over Amini's death are a major challenge to the government, analysts see no immediate threat to Iran's leaders because the elite security forces have stamped out protests in the past.Iran has blamed armed Iranian Kurdish dissidents of involvement in the unrest, particularly in the northwest where most of Iran's up to 10 million Kurds live.Iran's Revolutionary Guards launched an artillery and drone attack on Iranian militant opposition bases in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, the second such attack in two days, state media said.",

    "content": "Days after an accident led to the death of former Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry, Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari announced that there will be fines against people not wearing seatbelts while sitting in the back of the car. While there is already a law around it, which makes it mandatory, it is hardly enforced across the country.Mistry's death in the car crash has ignited debates across the country over road safety and mechanisms in the car to safeguard human life. According to the International Road Federation (IRF), India accounts for more than 11 per cent of road accident deaths worldwide with 426 lives lost every day and 18 every hour.As the government prepares to introduce strict laws and harsh penalties against people not following road safety rules, we try to explain how the internal safety mechanism inside your car like seatbelts and airbags work and how they can protect your life.There are two basic safety mechanisms in every car that work to save its occupants in pre and post-accident situations. While the pre-accident safety system includes traction control, an antilock braking system, and electronic stability control among several others, the post-accident safety system includes seatbelts and airbags.Experts maintain that these safety systems have to work in tandem to save the occupants of the car. In the case of Mistry's accident, one such system was missing, the rear seatbelt was not used which led to a head-on collision and instant death.Also Read | Cyrus Mistry death: Autopsy reveals multiple fracturesCentre had earlier this year made three-point seat belts for all front-facing passengers in a car mandatory for automakers to provide, which is also applicable for the back and the middle seat in the rear row. The seatbelts are designed on a retractor mechanism that sits at the bottom of the car and aims to protect not just your upper body but also the torso in case of a collision.The seat belts are connected to a spool that has a spring inside that applies rotational force or torque. The spool is then attached to one end of the webbing. When the webbing is pulled out, the spool moves counterclockwise, turning the spring in the same direction and retracting back. The retractor is designed to have a locking mechanism that holds the spool from rotating back when pulled with force, mimicking a collision.Also Read | Highway where Cyrus Mistry's car crashed is prone to accidentsAs the car stops suddenly, the seat belt directs the force to spread throughout the body and not let it concentrate on a single area as G-forces begin to act. The retractor mechanism stops you from being violently thrown forward and instantly pulls you back, stopping you from hitting the dashboard or the headrest in case you are sitting in the back.Another critical post-accident safety system is airbags that run on not just electronics but also chemistry. There are 6-8 airbags in a car, but on average, the cars on Indian roads have two front airbags that are deployed for the safety of the driver and co-passengers.There are other airbags as well that counter the side impacts known as curtain airbags and the knee airbags save the bottom part of the body in case of a collision.The airbags in themselves are not inflated by electronic commands, instead, they use chemistry \u2014 precisely a chemical compound known as sodium azide. According to Scientific American, when sensors on the car detect a structural deformity, they beam an electrical signal to the canister containing sodium azide, detonating a small amount of a igniter compound. This detonation produces heat, which triggers the decomposition of sodium azide and the chemical reaction generates nitrogen gas which fills up the airbags.All this happens in just 30 milliseconds of the accident, which is 0.03 seconds. Within 50 milliseconds of the collision, the airbags are out and the passenger hits the fabric as it begins to deflate. This deflation absorbs the energy created from the impact and saves your life.An understanding of these safety systems can help save your lives and, while there are rules around road safety, it is their implementation that requires renewed focus in India.Also Read | Cyrus Mistry accident Mercedes team collects car data",

The Cuban president led the campaign for the adoption of the code.By Cuban standards, Sunday's turnout was relatively modest, and a 33% 'no' vote relatively large in the communist-run country, where previous referendums have seen the government position receiving near unanimous approval.The dissent is an indication of both how Cuba is changing and the current dire economic circumstances, which have seen long power outages and lines for food, medicine and fuel.Sunday's vote was also the first of its kind since most residents have had access to the internet, which has let dissenting views spread more widely.",

Diplomatic sources had said some countries, including China, were unhappy with language that had already been agreed and enshrined in past deals. read moreAdvertisement \u00b7 Scroll to continueThe EU's climate change chief on Monday accused \"the biggest emitter on this planet\" a reference to China of attempting to backtrack on the Glasgow Climate Pact, which capped two weeks of U.N. negotiations in November.\"Some of the very, very big players on this planet are trying to roll back from what they had agreed in Glasgow,\" Frans Timmermans told a meeting in Rotterdam on climate adaptation in Africa.\"And some of them, even the biggest emitter on this planet, try and hide behind developing countries in using arguments that I think, at some point, are no longer viable,\" said Timmermans, who is executive vice president of the European Commission.China is responsible for about 30% of annual emissions, making it the world's biggest emitter today while the United States is second and the EU third. The United States, however, is the biggest emitter historically.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs rebuffed the accusation, and said Beijing demanded an \"accurate\" interpretation of past climate deals.The 2015 Paris Agreement, for example, committed wealthy countries whose emissions are largely responsible for global warming to cutting carbon dioxide emissions fastest while also supporting developing countries in following suit. Under the Paris deal, China is defined as a developing country.\"As a developing country itself, China has always stood by the vast number of developing countries and firmly safeguarded their common interests,\" a spokesperson from the Chinese ministry said.The failure by rich nations to deliver promised climate finance has raised tensions in global climate negotiations. The 27-country EU is the biggest provider of climate finance, according to OECD data.China has pledged to peak emissions by 2030 a target which could see its emissions increase in the near term as it opens new coal plants. Beijing has resisted calls from Europe to revise this goal to cut emissions faster.The Foreign Affairs Ministry said China's low-carbon transition remained \"firm\", and pointed to European countries burning more coal as they race to replace Russian gas.\"The green and low-carbon process is now encountering countercurrents,\" the ministry said, referring to European coal use.European policymakers have said the uptick in coal is a temporary measure, and will not thwart climate targets. The EU has fixed into law its target to cut net emissions 55% by 2030, from 1990 levels.",

Ian, now a Category 2 hurricane, has prompted urgent evacuations as it is expected to make landfall anytime in the middle of this week.\"The eye of the storm is located around 150 miles southeast of the western tip of Cuba and Ian is moving north-northwest near 13 mph,\" a Miami-based National Hurricane Centre said. Meanwhile, Florida could start feeling the impact as early as Tuesday.The forecast for Ian has also shown an \"unprecedented rate of strengthening from a tropical storm to a powerful hurricane,\" CNN reported.By the time the hurricane moves to Cuba, it is likely to intensify into a Category 3 with winds of 120 mph or greater. Parts of Cuba and Jamaica are expected to witness flash flooding and mudslides.A mandatory evacuation order has been issued to residents of Florida's Tampa and similar orders are expected to be issued in other states.Residents across Florida scrambled to place sandbags around their homes and stockpile emergency supplies on Monday, emptying store shelves as Hurricane Ian spun toward the state.The Biden administration declared a public health emergency for the state on Monday and said it was working with local officials to provide support.The governor has mobilized 5,000 National Guard members. An additional 2,000 are coming from Tennessee, Georgia and North Carolina and nearby states have troops on standby.Key West Mayor Teri Johnston said her island city could be one of the first places in the United States hit by Hurricane Ian.Johnston said homeowners and vacation rentals had nailed up storm shutters or boards across windows as residents stocked up enough food and water to last a week.The first strong winds ahead of Hurricane Ian began to pound Cuba's south coast late on Monday as officials rushed to evacuate residents, secure boats and batten down homes amid warnings of a life-threatening storm surge.The fast-growing storm is centered about 155 miles (250 km) southeast of Cabo San Antonio, in far western Cuba, but has jumped in intensity in recent hours with maximum sustained winds of 100 miles per hour (155 km per hour), making it a Category 2 hurricane on a five-step scale.Ian follows Hurricane Fiona, a powerful Category 4 storm that carved a path of destruction last week through Puerto Rico, leaving most of the U.S. territory without power and potable water. Fiona then barreled through the Turks and Caicos Islands, skirted Bermuda and slammed into Canada's Atlantic coast, where critical infrastructure might take months to repair.",

    "content": "Wasim Akram has delivered a damning verdict on Pakistan's batters and grilled the batting coach Mohammed Yousuf over their versatility.Pakistan suffered an eight-wicket loss in the sixth T20I against England with the decider to be played on Sunday. The batters of the hosts have been inconsistent throughout the series and Akram isn't best pleased with it.During a television chat with batting coach Yousuf, the bowling legend slammed the Pakistan batters for not being versatile and said that none of them even put in an effort to do something out of the ordinary.Akram poked fun at the batting coach to ask the players to play at least shots across 180 degrees of the ground as 360 would be tough for them.\"Ben Duckett doesn't let the bowlers, especially the spinners settle when they come on to bowl. He plays shots everywhere. If I were playing against Pakistan, I would know where the batters would hit their shots. They are not versatile. No one even tries to do something out of the ordinary.\"\"360 is a bit too much to ask for, just play 180 degrees. This is the practice you do, and if you do then why don't you apply in the match,\" Akram told Yousuf.The batting coach tried his best to respond to the Pakistan legend and said that the batters are trying their best during matches.\"I'm making a conscious effort. I talk to (spin bowling coach) Saqlain bhai about this. When they play spinners, I stand behind and suggest our batsmen a number of different shots, play this shot at this ball, this at this.\"\"The first stage is to practice in the nets, the second is to implement those in practice games, but we don't get too many of those. We keep telling that if there is an intent, there is no problem in getting out. The intent, in the modern game, is to hit a boundary every ball, if it's a difficult ball, take a single. That's the demand of modern-day cricket. The players know that and they are trying,\" said Yousuf.",

Industrialist and former MP Vijay Mallya left the country on March 2, 2016, the day a clutch of public sector banks moved the Debt Recovery Tribunal to recover Rs 9,000 crore unpaid dues to his now-defunct Kingfisher Airline.Mehul Choksi, one of the prime accused in the alleged over Rs 13,000-crore PNB loan fraud case, too fled to Antigua and Barbuda just as ED and CBI zeroed in on him.\"Every aircraft operator shall transfer passenger name record information not later than 24 hours before the departure time; or at the departure time - wheels off,\" the regulation said, adding the information would be retained in the customs systems for up to five years.It further said that for each act of non-compliance to these regulations, the aircraft operators would have to pay a penalty of a minimum of Rs 25,000 and a maximum of Rs 50,000.With regard to sharing of information with other law enforcement agencies or foreign states, the regulation said that the National Customs Targeting Centre-Passenger may share the relevant information on a \"case-to-case basis\" with other law enforcement agencies or government departments of India or any other country.KPMG in India, Partner, Indirect Tax, Abhishek Jain said the objective of said regulations is to obtain relevant passenger data for risk analysis to proactively prevent, detect, investigate or prosecute offences under the Customs law or any other domestic or international law.\"The onus of timely collecting and sharing such information has been put on the airline operators. Further, while strict privacy guidelines have been stipulated under the said regulations, the government should ensure that the same are duly enforced to prevent unauthorised usage,\" Jain added.ALSO READ | IndiGo flight receives hoax bomb threat in Bengaluru, 2 suspects identified",

The launch vehicle with the Orion spacecraft will then be hauled back into the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB).The Artemis engineers will replace the seal on an interface, called the quick disconnect, between the liquid hydrogen fuel feed line on the mobile launcher and the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket during the repairs. It was a quick disconnect which had developed a hydrogen leak, following which the launch attempt was scrubbed.\"Performing the work at the pad requires technicians to set up an enclosure around the work area to protect the hardware from the weather and other environmental conditions, but enables engineers to test the repair under cryogenic, or supercold, conditions,\" Nasa said in a blog update.Also Read | Artemis-1 suffers fuel leak, second launch attempt scrubbedOn Saturday, engineers detected hydrogen fuel leaking from the engine section at the bottom of the rocket, forcing the tanking operation to be stopped as troubleshooting began. It was believed to be a gap around a seal in the supply line as the countdown clock remained active.The Space Launch System (SLS) with the Orion spacecraft will have to be rolled back into the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) to perform additional work that does not require the use of the cryogenic facilities available only at the pad.\"Performing the work at the pad also allows teams to gather as much data as possible to understand the cause of the issue,\" Nasa said, adding that the rocket will have to be moved back into VAB to meet the current requirement by the Eastern Range for the certification on the flight termination system.Also Read | Hit by leaks, Artemis-1 mission to Moon unlikely to launch anytime soonMeanwhile, engineers will also check plate coverings on other umbilical interfaces to ensure there are no leaks present at those locations.

Twelve astronauts walked on the moon during Nasa\u2019s Apollo program, the last time in 1972.With a two-week launch blackout period, the rocket is now grounded until late September or October.

He was addressing a question in the House on whether the government proposed to ensure a timely constitution of the eighth Central Pay Commission for central government employees so that it could be implemented on January 1, 2026.\"In order to compensate central government employees for the erosion in the real value of their salaries on account of inflation, the dearness allowances (DA) are paid to them and the rate of DA is revised periodically every six months on the basis of the rate of inflation as per All India Consumer Price lndex for Industrial Workers released by Labour Bureau under the Ministry of Labour & Employment, the minister said.Central government employees are eagerly waiting for another hike in the DA rate in the second half of the financial year. As inflation rates are being retained, the Cabinet is likely to increase the DA for all the central government employees and pensioners and a decision in this regard may be announced soon. DA is calculated on the basis of retail inflation which has been over 7% for quite some time now.According to reports, the DA is likely to be hiked between 3% and 4%.In July 2021, the Centre revised the DA from 17% to 28% as per the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission. Again, the Union cabinet approved a hike of 3% in DA for the employees in October 2021 effective from July 1, 2021.The central government decided to increase the DA by another 3% in January 2022. At present, all the government employees are receiving DA at 34%. More than 50 lakh government employees and 65 lakh pensioners are getting the benefits of the revision of the DA.The 7th Central pay commission was set up by the government on February 28, 2014. The Centre forms a pay commission to revise the salary structure of the government employees after 10 years.",

Researchers have concluded that this unique rainfall could be more common on ice giant planets than we had thought.Scientists from the Department of Energy\u2019s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory have discovered the presence of oxygen, which makes diamond formation more likely, as they investigated the process that more closely resembles the chemical makeup of Neptune and Uranus.The study published in the journal Science Advances states that extreme conditions inside ice giants such as Uranus and Neptune can result in peculiar chemistry and structural transitions like precipitation of diamonds or superionic water. The paper provides a more complete picture of how diamond rain forms on other planets and, here on Earth, could lead to a new way of fabricating nanodiamonds.Also Read | European orbiter survives major blow from Sun near VenusResearchers in 2017 observed \u201cdiamond rain\u201d for the first time as it formed in high-pressure conditions, the same as that experienced on Uranus and Neptune. It is the extremely high pressure, which squeezes hydrogen and carbon found in the interior of these planets to form solid diamonds that sink slowly further into the interior.\u201cThe earlier paper was the first time that we directly saw diamond formation from any mixtures. Since then, there have been quite a lot of experiments with different pure materials. But inside planets, it\u2019s much more complicated; there are a lot more chemicals in the mix. And so, what we wanted to figure out here was what sort of effect these additional chemicals have,\" Siegfried Glenzer, director of the High Energy Density Division at SLAC, said in a statement.Researchers used PET plastic, which is regularly used in food packaging, and plastic bottles, to reproduce the composition of these planets more accurately. They turned to the high-powered optical laser at the Matter in Extreme Conditions (MEC) instrument at SLAC\u2019s Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) and created shockwaves in the plastic.Also Read | How were the Pyramids of Giza built? A long-lost branch of Nile helpedUsing X-ray pulses, they analysed the changes that the plastic went through from the shockwaves and watched as the atoms of the material rearranged into small diamond regions. The team then measured how fast and large those regions grew and found that these diamond regions grew up to a few nanometers wide.Analysis revealed that it was the presence of oxygen in the material, which triggered the nanodiamonds to grow at lower pressures and temperatures than previously observed and estimated that diamonds on Neptune and Uranus would become much larger than the nanodiamonds produced in these experiments.\u201cOur experiment demonstrates how these elements can change the conditions in which diamonds are formed on ice giants. If we want to accurately model planets, then we need to get as close as we can to the actual composition of the planetary interior,\u201d SLAC scientist and collaborator Silvia Pandolfi said.Also Read | New clues of a watery past detected on Mars",

This translates into how much regulation and subsidies you can do in terms of greening the economy and energy system,\" study co-author Per Espen Stoknes told Reuters.To track wellbeing, the researchers created an 'Average Wellbeing Index' using data including disposable income, income inequality, government services, the climate crisis, perceived progress, and their relationship to measures of social trust.Using two scenarios - labelled 'Too Little Too Late', with no change to human behaviour, and 'The Giant Leap', where the world's economic and social systems are transformed - the model seeks to show how differing policies would impact the world.Under the business as usual scenario, the wellbeing of the average worker - taken to mean those who spend most of what they earn in a year - peaks around the year 2000, before declining out to 2050 and then levelling to 2100, despite continued growth in the global economy over the same period.Also Read | Why should melting Himalayas scare you?

The functions were characterised by their love for nature, with the decor being inspired by natural elements like florals, jute, wood etc. The couple did a fun Phoolon Ki Holi as their friends and family showered flower petals on them in a customary way. This was followed by mehendi for Richa and her friends in a colourful setup. The evening was followed by performances by the couple's friends and cousins. Richa's best friend did a fun surprise performance for the couple, while her brother sang her a song and did a bhangra performance too. The cutest part was the couple dancing to two of their songs, one of them being Ambarsariya from their film, Fukrey.Here are the glimpses:Richa Chadha and Ali Fazal looked regal at their cocktail ceremony on the night of September 30. The bride-to-be looked elegant in her custom-made Kresha Bajaj saree. However, the best part was a drape with a special significance to the couple. It had the couple's love story embroidered onto it. Ali complemented his bride by wearing an Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla sherwani. The couple hosted their family and friends from across Delhi with about 300 guests in attendance. Richa had donned jewellery which was custom made for her by an ancestral Bikaneri jeweller family.The first pictures of Richa Chadha and Ali Fazal's pre-wedding festivities were out on September 30. They looked much in love in the photos clicked by Joseph Radhik. Richa looked beautiful in a custom-made outfit by Rahul Mishra, while Ali Fazal looked dapper in an angrakha by Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla.As far as their wedding reception is concerned, the couple will host their guests at a 176-year-old mill in Mumbai, instead of a 5-star hotel.",

Several areas of the city remain inundated after torrential rains overnight.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted heavy rains in the state on Tuesday as well.In its daily weather forecast, the IMD has said that fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy falls accompanied by thunderstorms and lightning is very likely over coastal and south interior Karnataka during the next five days.Also Read | Drinking water supply to be shut for 2 days in rain-hit areas of Bengaluru\"There have been heavy rains in Bengaluru, I have spoken to the Commissioner (BBMP) and other officials. I have asked officials to depute two State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) teams to Mahdevapura and Bommanahalli zones in the city that have been worst affected, with boats and other equipment,\" Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai said amid the latest forecast.Bengaluru city on Monday night received 13 centimeters of rain, the highest in the state, which battered civic amenities. Monsoon activity became vigorous over 16 districts of south interior Karnataka, while it remained weak over the coastal regions of the state comparatively.The excess rain was due to a shear zone that had developed nearly 4.5-5.8 kilometers above mean sea level that deposited heavy rains in south interior Karnataka, including Bengaluru City. A shear zone is a monsoon weather feature that is an area filled with opposing winds concentrating heavy rain in that zone.Video | Heavy rain continues to batter Bengaluru, residential areas flooded | VideosDr Geeta Agnihotri, head of the Regional Meteorological Centre, Bengaluru, told indiatoday.in that the very heavy rains in Bengaluru city were due to the shear zone that had formed. \"It's a normal occurrence during monsoons just as the formation of troughs, circulations, and low-pressure regions that drive monsoonal rains,\" she said.While the IMD expects low to moderate rains in the state today, heavy rains are expected to lash the city on Tuesday that could go on for the next few days. The rains are likely due to a north-south trough forming over north interior Karnataka to Comorin and across interior Tamil Nadu at nine kilometers above sea level.The monsoonal trough is a low-pressure area, which is a semi-permanent feature of the monsoon circulation. Southward migration of the trough results in an active/vigorous monsoon over major parts of India.\"In contrast, the northward migration of this trough leads to a break in monsoon conditions over a major part of India and heavy rains along the foothills of the Himalayas and sometimes floods in the Brahmaputra river,\" IMD has said.Also Read | Boats deployed in flooded Bengaluru suburbMeanwhile, \"a cyclonic circulation also lies over the Comorin area and adjoining the Maldives at lower tropospheric levels,\" Dr Geeta Agnihotri said.More rains are expected to worsen the situation in the state and especially in Bengaluru, which has been marred by flooded drains, waterlogged streets, and submerged residential areas.Also Read | Heavy rains turn roads into rivers in Bengaluru",

    "content": "While the Pyramids of Giza, the iconic relics of the old Egyptian kingdom, have withstood the test of time, surviving thousands of years, they remain enigmatic in their own way. Archeologists from the world over continue to speculate how these massive structures were built at a time when technology was limited.Nearly 2.3 million blocks of granite and limestone with an average weight of two tons were moved across the desert from the banks of the Nile and pushed on top of each other to raise the mountainous structure. What's even more astounding is the fact that the bank of the Nile today is far away from the pyramids.A new study offers a unique clue about how these massive limestone blocks were transported. It was a channel that emerged from the Nile and cut through the desert stretch of the pyramids, easing the transport of these blocks 4,500 years ago.Also Read | Scientists issue 'warning to humanity' as global tree species face extinctionThat arm of the Nile has been lost since then.A study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences states that the former waterscape and higher river levels around 4,500 years ago facilitated the construction of the Giza Pyramid Complex.\"It is now accepted that ancient Egyptian engineers exploited a former channel of the Nile to transport building materials and provisions to the Giza plateau,\" researchers said.Led by a team of researchers from Coll\u00e8ge de France, the team found evidence of the Khufu branch, a fluvial channel that enabled navigation to the Pyramid Harbor complex. They used pollen-derived vegetation patterns to reconstruct 8,000 years of water flow variations on the Giza floodplain.The work has its roots in the discovery of papyrus fragments at an ancient harbour near the Red Sea in 2013 that had details about Khufu\u2019s reign and efforts to transport limestone to Giza through the Nile. The scroll contained details of the mega move by an official named Merer and his men.Also Read | India's first night sky sanctuary to come up in Ladakh, boost Astro tourismThe team drilled in the desert near the Giza harbour along the proposed route led by Merer and collected five sediment cores from a depth of 30 feet. They analysed the pollen grains for plant life and discovered 61 species of plants and ferns from the area which is a desert today. The findings showed the major ecological changes the region has been through.Using the data from this pollen, the team estimated water levels in the area and also found the region was underwater nearly 8000 years ago. It dried up over the next few thousand years. The team found evidence of the channel that was deep enough to transport and not high enough to flood.Also Read | Hit by leaks, Artemis-1 mission to Moon unlikely to launch anytime soonHowever, as Egypt became drier, the channel was lost and became unusable, but by then the construction was likely completed.Researchers have in the past proposed that ancient engineers from Egypt could have made artificial channels of rivers through the desert to ease transportation. However, there was limited evidence to support the theory.In the new research as well, the team pointed out that there is a paucity of environmental evidence regarding when, where, and how these ancient landscapes evolved.Also Read | Why should melting Himalayas scare you?

The European Space Agency (ESA) has now found new clues that point to a watery past of the Red Planet.The Mars Express has looked into Holden Basin, which is part of a series of channels and sinks called the Uzboi-Ladon-Morava (ULM) outflow where water once likely flowed. Scientists believe the water would have started in channels that drain into the Argyre Planitia, then flowed through Uzboi Vallis into the location now scarred by the Holden Crater.Ladon Valles and Holden Crater, which are part of the basin, contain layered and phyllosilicate-bearing deposits, which are a type of mineral also found on Earth, with one example being clay.Also Read | Scientists issue 'warning to humanity' as global tree species face extinctionScientists believe that these could serve as a reaction center for organic molecules, which make up all living things on Earth, and past experiments suggest that phyllosilicates could have played a role in the origin of life.The space agency released a series of detailed maps that show Mars\u2019 Grand Canyon, Valles Marineris, and the crater where water would have collected before streaming through Ladon Valles to Ladon Basin and beyond. It is worth mentioning that the names Holden Basin and Ladon Basin are not officially recognized by the International Astronomical Union.\"The complex history of the ULM outflow system makes it an interesting target to explore in more detail with Mars orbiters and rovers,\" ESA said in a statement.Also Read | Webb telescope finds planet bigger than Jupiter outside Solar SystemThe Holder Crater is nearly 140 kilometers wide and formed when Mars was hit by a space rock and is filled with material that was ejected from the massive strike. As the crater shows no evidence that significant amounts of water flowed through it, it very likely formed after the ULM system had mostly dried out.\"Due to its interesting geology and potential for clues to the past life, Holden Crater was on the shortlist of landing sites for NASA\u2019s Mars Science Laboratory and Perseverance rover,\" ESA said. However, the rover was later landed in the Jazero crater, where it has been collecting samples to be sent to Earth for deeper analysis as it continues to look for signs of ancient microbial life.Also Read | Hope probe discovers unique auroras around Mars triggered by space turbulence",

Since then, scores of women have taken to the streets to protest against the morality police in the country.According to reports, over 40 people have lost their lives, including members of the security forces.

But they are required to wear the hijab as well as long, loose-fitting robes. Unmarried men and women are barred from mingling.The rules, which date back to the days after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, are enforced by the morality police. The force, officially known as the Guidance Patrol, is stationed across public areas. It is made up of men as well as women.Enforcement was eased under former President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate who at one point accused the morality police of being overly aggressive. In 2017, the head of the force said it would no longer arrest women for violating the dress code.But under Raisi, a hard-liner elected last year, agents of the morality police appear to have been unleashed. The U.N. human rights office says young women have been slapped in the face, beaten with batons and shoved into police vehicles in recent months.",

Every day she climbs up and down several flights of stairs carrying heavy water bottles filled with a hose outside.\"All the family's savings were invested in this house,\" Xu, 55, told Reuters from the Xiulan County Mansion complex, her room bare except for a mosquito net-covered bed, a few necessities and empty bottles on the floor. She declined to give her full name, citing the sensitivity of the matter.Xu and about 20 other buyers living in Xiulan County Mansion share a makeshift outdoor toilet and gather during the day at a table and benches in the central courtyard area.ALSO READ | US warns of catastrophic consequences if Russia uses nuclear weapons in UkraineThey are part of a movement of home buyers around China who have moved into what they call \"rotting\" apartments, either to pressure developers and authorities to complete them or out of financial necessity, as numerous cash-strapped builders halt construction amid the country's deep real estate slump.Shanghai E-House Real Estate Research Institute estimated in July that stalled projects accounted for 3.85% of China's housing market in the first half of 2022, equivalent to an area of 231 million square metres.While some local governments have taken steps to prop up the property market by setting up bailout funds, buyers like Xu, who paid deposits in advance and are on the hook for mortgages, remain in limbo.The proliferation of unfinished apartments has sparked unprecedented collective disobedience, fuelled by social media: in late June, thousands of home buyers in at least 100 cities threatened to halt mortgage payments to protest stalled construction.The overall property market is highly sensitive to cases of unfinished apartments because 90% of new houses bought in China are purchased \"off plans\" while still under construction, said Yan Yuejin, research director at Shanghai E-House.\"If this issue is not resolved, it will affect property transactions, the government's credibility, and it could exacerbate the developers' debt problems,\" he said.China's deep property slump, along with disruptions caused by strict anti-COVID measures, are dragging on the world's second largest economy just as the ruling Communist Party gears up for its once-in-five-years Congress next month.ALSO READ | China's Communist Party says all delegates 'elected' for key Congress set by President XiXu bought her two-bedroom, 70 square metre flat in early 2019, about a year after its developer, Jiadengbao Real Estate, started construction and began marketing apartments for around 6,000 yuan ($851) per square metre, which they said would come with facilities such as floor heating and a shared swimming pool.Work progressed quickly at first, with blocks in the planned 34 tower complex going up one after another.But in June 2020, Jiadengbao Real Estate hit the headlines after a court accused its parent company of illegal fund-raising and seized 340 million yuan worth of its properties, including a number of flats in Xiulan County Mansion.Construction stopped in mid-2020, which Xu found out months later, describing her feelings at the time as \"crashing from paradise\".Jiadengbao Real Estate did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.Since the debt crisis erupted in 2021, thousands more home buyers have been caught in similar predicaments as cash-strapped developers went into bankruptcy or abandoned struggling projects.ALSO READ | Was there a massive cancellation of flights in China and empty airspace over Beijing?On a recent day, the main block of buildings at Xiulan County Mansion was surrounded by a tall blue fence while the clubhouse, touted in promotional materials, was covered in a dense undergrowth. Cement mixers, iron poles, and piles of debris lay strewn around.Xu, who is unemployed, said she bought the apartment for her only son, with the hope that he would be able to raise a family there. She said her son and her husband, who live far away in the northern province of Hebei, blame her for their financial predicament, and no longer speak to her.\"We don't know how long we will have to live here because the government has not said anything officially,\" she said.She hopes the Guilin government will step in to help.The city government did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.Housing authorities in Baoding, the northern city where Xu is from and where Jiadengbao Real Estate's parent company is registered, said last November the city government and Communist Party committee had set up a group to resolve the issue.\"If the government really wants to protect people's livelihoods, and resume construction, we will go back home,\" Xu said.",

Greg Abbott defended it with an assurance: Texas would get to work eliminating rapes.One year later, Lindsey LeBlanc is busy as ever helping rape victims in a college town outside Houston.\u201cThe numbers have stayed consistently high,\u201d said LeBlanc, executive director of the Sexual Assault Resource Center in Bryan, near Texas A&M University. Despite hiring two additional counselors in the past six months, she still has a waitlist for victims.\u201cWe are struggling to keep up with demand,\u201d she said.The constant caseloads in Texas are another example of how Republicans have struggled to defend zero-exception abortion bans that are unpopular in public polling, have caused uproar in high-profile cases and are inviting political risk heading into November\u2019s midterm elections. A year since Texas\u2019 law went into effect in September 2021, at least a dozen states also have bans that make no exceptions in cases of rape or incest.ALSO READ | Giorgia Meloni set to become Italy's first woman PM after triumph in electionThe absence of exceptions has caused divisions among Republicans, including in West Virginia, where a new law signed this month allows a brief window for rape and incest victims to obtain abortions only if they report to law enforcement first. Recently, South Carolina Republicans scuttled a proposed ban after failing to get enough GOP support.\u201cIt really disgusts me,\u201d said Republican South Carolina state Sen. Katrina Shealy, ripping into her male colleagues on the floor of the state Senate.Republican U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, also of South Carolina, allowed exceptions under the proposed national abortion ban he introduced last week. The proposal has virtually no chance of passing, with even GOP leaders not immediately backing it, reflecting how Republicans have broadly struggled to navigate the issue of abortion with voters since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this summer.Overwhelming majorities of voters think their state should generally allow abortion in specific cases, including rape, incest or if the health of the pregnant person is endangered. Even Republicans are seeing it as a line with some voters.\u201cIt\u2019s a very gray issue,\u201d said Claudia Alcazar, the GOP chairwoman in Starr County along the Texas-Mexico border that has become a new political battleground after Republicans made big gains with more conservative Hispanic voters in 2020.She said she knows those who are \u201chardcore, never have abortion for any reason, period. And then I have the other ones that are like, \u2018Well, you know, it depends.\u2019\u201dALSO READ | Unrest erupts near Iranian embassy in London over Mahsa Amini's deathIn Texas, the blowback was swift when Abbott said last September: \u201cTexas will work tirelessly to make sure that we eliminate all rapists from the streets.\u201d Critics called it detached from reality. A sexual assault hotline in Houston has answered almost 4,800 calls through August this year \u2014 putting it on track to exceed last year\u2019s volume of 4,843.As of this summer, all abortions were banned in Texas except if it would save a mother\u2019s life.Asked what Abbott has done in the past year to eliminate rape, spokeswoman Renae Eze highlighted older measures to clear rape test kit backlogs, a law signed in June aimed at coordinating and expanding sexual assault resources and a task force his office launched in 2019 to address the issue.\u201cTo prevent such heinous crimes before they happen, and to prosecute any criminals to the full extent of the law, Governor Abbott has aggressively fought against defunding the police and led bail reform efforts to prevent the release of dangerous criminals,\u201d Eze said in a statement.More than 14,000 rape crimes have been reported in Texas since the law took effect last year, according to data from the Texas Department of Public Safety. That was slightly down from the year before and consistent with a decline in other violent crime figures across the state.Crisis centers in Texas say the number of rape victims they\u2019ve accompanied to hospitals for exams is rebounding since the pandemic restrictions kept advocates from entering. The Women\u2019s Center in Fort Worth has made more than 650 visits to counsel victims undergoing exams in the past year compared to about 340 in the year prior, said Alisha Mathenia, the assistant director of crisis services at the center.The majority of sexual assaults are never reported to police, making any available data an incomplete picture. And about 8 out of 10 sexual assaults are committed by a person known to the victim, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network.\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about a large of number of rapists walking around on the street. That\u2019s a myth,\u201d said Democrat Donna Howard, a state representative in Austin who co-authored the bill creating Abbott\u2019s task force.At The SAFE Alliance in Austin, where sexual assault victims can get exams and medical care at its Eloise House, senior director Juliana Gonzales said it\u2019s admirable for Texas to work on rape prevention. \u201cBut I also think it\u2019s important for the state to live in the reality that we have to respond to sexual assault,\u201d she said.",

    "content": "Russia\u2019s rush to mobilize hundreds of thousands of recruits to staunch stinging losses in Ukraine is a tacit acknowledgement that its \u201carmy is not able to fight,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s president said Sunday, as splits sharpened in Europe over whether to welcome or turn away Russians fleeing the call-up.Speaking to U.S. broadcaster CBS, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also said he\u2019s bracing for more Russian strikes on Ukraine\u2019s electrical infrastructure, as the Kremlin seeks to ramp up the pressure on Ukraine and its Western backers as the weather gets colder. Zelenskyy warned that this winter \u201cwill be very difficult.\u201d\u201cThey will shoot missiles, and they will target our electric grid. This is a challenge, but we are not afraid of that.\u201d he said on \u201cFace the Nation.\u201dHe portrayed the Russian mobilization \u2014 its first such call-up since World War II \u2014 as a signal of weakness, not strength, saying: \u201cThey admitted that their army is not able to fight with Ukraine anymore.\u201dZelenskyy also said Ukraine has received NASAMS air defense systems from the U.S. NASAMS uses surface-to-air missiles to track and shoot down incoming missiles or aircraft. Zelenskyy did not say how many Ukraine received.Although the European Union is now largely off limits to most Russians, with direct flights stopped and its land borders increasingly closed to them, an exodus of Russian men fleeing military service is creating divisions among European officials over whether they should be granted safe haven.ALSO READ| Russia holds votes in 4 occupied regions of Ukraine, Kyiv says residents coercedThe partial mobilization is also triggering protests in Russia, with new anti-war demonstrations on Sunday.In Dagestan, one of Russia\u2019s poorer regions in the North Caucasus, police fired warning shots to try to disperse more than 100 people who blocked a highway while protesting Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s military call-up, Russian media reported.Dozens of women chanted \u201cNo to war!\u201d in the Dagestani capital of Makhachkala on Sunday. Videos of the protests showed women in head scarves chasing police away from the rally and standing in front of police cars carrying detained protesters, demanding their release.Women also protested in the Siberian city of Yakutsk, chanting \u201cNo to genocide!\u201d and marching in a circle around police, who later dragged some away or forced them into police vans, according to videos shared by Russian media.At least 2,000 people have been arrested in recent days for similar demonstrations around Russia. Many of those taken away have immediately received a call-up summons.Unconfirmed Russian media reports that the Kremlin might soon close Russian borders to men of fighting age are fueling panic and prompting more to flee.ALSO READ| Trouble grows for Russia as more non-aligned countries condemn Ukraine invasionZelenskyy in his nightly address on Sunday described Russia\u2019s mobilization as \u201ccriminal\u201d and reiterated his call for Russians to stand up to it.\u201cFight so that they don\u2019t send your children to die, all of those who they can take in this criminal Russian mobilization,\u201d Zelenskyy said, switching to Russian for a brief portion of his speech. \u201cBecause if you come to take the lives of our children, I will tell you as a father \u2014 we will not let you go alive.\u201dGerman officials have voiced a desire to help Russian men deserting military service and have called for a European-wide solution. Germany has held out the possibility of granting asylum to deserters and those refusing the draft.In France, senators are arguing that Europe has a duty to help and warned that not granting refuge to fleeing Russians could play into Putin\u2019s hands, feeding his narrative of Western hostility to Russia.\u201cClosing our frontiers would fit neither with our values nor our interests,\u201d a group of more than 40 French senators said.Yet other EU countries are adamant that asylum shouldn\u2019t be offered to Russian men fleeing now \u2014 when the war has moved into its eighth month. They include Lithuania, which borders Kaliningrad, a Russian Baltic Sea exclave. Its foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, tweeted: \u201cRussians should stay and fight. Against Putin.\u201dALSO READ| Russia admits to making mistake after old, sick people mobilised for Ukraine warHis counterpart in Latvia, also an EU member bordering Russia, said the exodus poses \u201cconsiderable security risks\u201d for the 27-nation bloc and that those fleeing now can\u2019t be considered conscientious objectors since they did not act when Russia invaded Ukraine in February.Many \u201cwere fine with killing Ukrainians, they did not protest then,\u201d the Latvian foreign minister, Edgars Rinkevics, tweeted. He added that they still have \u201cplenty of countries outside EU to go.\u201dFinland also said it intends to \u201csignificantly restrict\u201d entry to Russians entering the EU through its border with Russia. A Finnish opposition leader, Petteri Orpo, said fleeing Russian military reservists were an \u201cobvious\u201d security risk and \u201cwe must put our national security first.\u201dRussia is pressing on with its call-up of hundreds of thousands of men, seeking to reverse recent losses. Without control of the skies over Ukraine, Russia is also making increasing use of suicide drones from Iran, with more strikes reported Sunday in the Black Sea port city of Odesa.For Ukrainian and Russian military planners, the clock is ticking, with the approach of winter expected to make fighting much more complicated. Already, rainy weather is bringing muddy conditions that are starting to limit the mobility of tanks and other heavy weapons, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said Sunday.But the think-tank said Ukrainian forces are still gaining ground in their counteroffensive, launched in late August, that has rolled back the Russian occupation across large areas of the northeast and which also prompted Putin\u2019s new drive for reinforcements.The Kremlin said its initial aim is to add about 300,000 troops to its invasion force, which is struggling with equipment losses, mounting casualties and weakening morale. The mobilization marks a sharp shift from Putin\u2019s previous efforts to portray the war as a limited military operation that wouldn\u2019t interfere with most Russians\u2019 lives.ALSO READ| Shelling hits southern Ukraine, Russia in UN spotlight over escalationThe mobilization is running hand-in-hand with Kremlin-orchestrated votes in four occupied regions of Ukraine that could pave the way for their imminent annexation by Russia.Ukraine and its Western allies say the referendums in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in the south and the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions have no legal validity, not least because many tens of thousands of their people have fled. They also call them a \u201csham.\u201d Some footage has shown armed Russian troops going door-to-door to pressure Ukrainians into voting.The voting ends Tuesday and there\u2019s little doubt it will be declared a success by the Russian occupiers. The main questions then will be how soon Putin\u2019s regime will annex the four regions and how that will complicate the war.",

    "content": "A year after they warned that nearly one-third of tree species in the world are facing extinction, scientists have issued an urgent \"warning to humanity\" highlighting how billions of people will be affected by the loss. The paper comes just months ahead of the Kunming Biodiversity Conference 2022.Scientists warned that tree species extinction will lead to the loss of many other plants and animals and significantly alter the world's ecosystems. They pointed out that trees are of exceptional ecological importance, playing a major functional role in the world's ecosystems, while also supporting many other plants, animals, and fungi.The paper published in Plants People Planet of the New Phytologist Foundation states that it aims to raise awareness of the tree extinction crisis, which is a major environmental issue that requires urgent global attention.\"Evidence suggests that a third of the world's tree species are currently threatened with extinction, which represents a major ecological crisis.

It is worth mentioning that over 100 tree species are already extinct in the wild, and with billions of trees being destroyed each year, a third of species face extinction.\"We show the wide-ranging impact these tree extinctions may have on other species, on the ecosystems, and for humanity.

    "content": "The United States warned on Sunday of \"catastrophic consequences\" if Moscow uses nuclear weapons in Ukraine, after Russia's foreign minister said regions holding widely-criticised referendums would get full protection if annexed by Moscow.Votes were staged for a third day in four eastern Ukrainian regions, aimed at annexing territory Russia has taken by force. The Russian parliament could move to formalise the annexation within days.By incorporating the areas of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia into Russia, Moscow could portray efforts to retake them as attacks on Russia itself, a warning to Kyiv and its Western allies.ALSO READ | 'War has come to our homes': Flights sold-out as Putin orders partial military call-upU.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the United States would respond to any Russian use of nuclear weapons against Ukraine and had spelled out to Moscow the \"catastrophic consequences\" it would face.\"If Russia crosses this line, there will be catastrophic consequences for Russia,\" Sullivan told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" television program. \"The United States will respond decisively.\"The latest U.S. warning followed a thinly veiled nuclear threat made on Wednesday by President Vladimir Putin, who said Russia would use any weapons to defend its territory.Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made the point more directly at a news conference on Saturday after a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York in which he repeated Moscow's false claims to justify the invasion that the elected government in Kyiv was illegitimately installed and filled with neo-Nazis.Asked if Russia would have grounds for using nuclear weapons to defend annexed regions, Lavrov said Russian territory, including territory \"further enshrined\" in Russia's constitution in the future, was under the \"full protection of the state\".ALSO READ | Protests break out in Russia, over 1k detained as Putin orders partial military call-upBritish Prime Minister Liz Truss said Britain and its allies should not heed threats from Putin, who had made what she called a strategic mistake as he had not anticipated the strength of reaction from the West.\"We should not be listening to his sabre-rattling and his bogus threats,\" Truss told CNN in an interview broadcast on Sunday.\"Instead, what we need to do is continue to put sanctions on Russia and continue to support the Ukrainians.\"Ukraine and its allies have dismissed the referendums as a sham designed to justify an escalation of the war and a mobilisation drive by Moscow after recent battlefield losses.Russian news agencies quoted unidentified sources as saying the Russian parliament could debate bills to incorporate the new territories as soon as Thursday. State-run RIA Novosti said Putin could address parliament on Friday.Russia says the referendums, hastily organised after Ukraine recaptured territory in a counteroffensive this month, enable people in those regions to express their views.Luhansk's regional governor said Russian-backed officials were going door to door with ballot boxes and if residents failed to vote correctly their names were taken down.ALSO READ | Hundreds detained as Russians protest against war on Ukraine\"A woman walks down the street with what looks like a karaoke microphone telling everyone to take part in the referendum,\" Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai said in an interview posted online.\"Representatives of the occupation forces are going from apartment to apartment with ballot boxes. This is a secret ballot, right?\"The territory controlled by Russian forces in the four regions represents about 15% of Ukraine, of roughly the size of Portugal. It would add to Crimea, an area nearly the size of Belgium that Russia claims to have annexed in 2014.Ukrainian forces still control some territory in each region, including about 40% of Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia's provincial capital. Heavy fighting continued along the entire front, especially in northern Donetsk and in Kherson.President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who insists that Ukraine will regain all its territory, said on Sunday some of the clashes had yielded \"positive results\" for Kyiv.\"This is the Donetsk region, this is our Kharkiv region. This is the Kherson region, and also the Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia regions,\" he said in nightly video remarks.In a statement on Facebook, the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said Russia had launched four missile and seven air strikes and 24 instances of shelling on targets in Ukraine in the past 24 hours, hitting dozens of towns, including some in and around the Donetsk and Kherson regions.Reuters could not independently verify the accounts.PROTESTS IN RUSSIA OVER DRAFTOn Wednesday, Putin ordered Russia's first military mobilization since World War Two. The move triggered protests across Russia and sent many men of military age fleeing.Two of Russia's most senior lawmakers tackled on Sunday a string of mobilisation complaints, ordering regional officials to swiftly solve \"excesses\" stoking public anger.More than 2,000 people have been detained across Russia for draft protests, says independent monitoring group OVD-Info. In Russia, where criticism of the conflict is banned, the demonstrations are among the first signs of discontent since the war began.In the Muslim-majority southern Russian region of Dagestan, police clashed with protesters, with at least 100 people detained.Zelenskiy acknowledged the protests in his video address.\"Keep on fighting so that your children will not be sent to their deaths - all those that can be drafted by this criminal Russian mobilisation,\" he said.\"Because if you come to take away the lives of our children - and I am saying this as a father - we will not let you get away alive.\"",

    "content": "US-based crypto project Nomad has been hit by a massive hack where almost $200 million dollars have been compromised on the platform. It is said that the hackers exploited a vulnerability in the transactional call data function of the platform and exploited multiple users.Confirming the hack, the official Twitter handle of the company tweeted out relevant details about an investigation into the matter and that more updates were to be followed.We are aware of the incident involving the Nomad token bridge. We are currently investigating and will provide updates when we have them.Many experts believe this to be a very different and chaotic hack than some of the earlier ones in crypto.Nomad is a US-based crypto project focused on interoperability between different networks, which is basically a way for two blockchains to be connected. The project basically uses programmable bridges to exchange different cryptos on various blockchains in a much cheaper and more secure manner.The company recently announced a list of investors in its $22 million funding round where venture capital firms like Polychain Capital, Crypto.com, Coinbase and Ethereal Ventures were some of the big companies pooling in the cash.The irony of the whole situation is that Nomad was betting big on its security and touting itself as being a security-first cross-chain messaging protocol. So much so, that in January, its CEO even went out saying that it\u2019s \u201csecure period\u201d.\u201cWe\u2019re secure period\u201d \u2014 @pranaymohanA security researcher who goes by the pseudonym \u201csamczsun\u201d on Twitter, explained the hack when \u201ca routine upgrade marked the zero hash as a valid root, which had the effect of allowing messages to be spoofed on Nomad. Attackers abused this to copy/paste transactions and quickly drained the bridge in a frenzied free-for-all.\u201dIf you want to dive into the technical nitty-gritty of the whole hack, you can have a look at this thread from the security analyst.1/ Nomad just got drained for over $150M in one of the most chaotic hacks that Web3 has ever seen. How exactly did this happen, and what was the root cause? Allow me to take you behind the scenes pic.twitter.com/Y7Q3fZ7ezmExperts are saying that the vulnerability was so easy to exploit other hackers could have just copied the Nomad hacker\u2019s transaction call data and used it to hack the platform.What\u2019s even more bizarre is that this very vulnerability was mentioned in the audit report that was published by QSP-19 a few months ago.The hack took place in a matter of hours when the platform was drained from $200 million to nil. As per some of the tweets on Nomad\u2019s official Twitter handle, some of the money has been withdrawn by White Hat hackers and ethical researchers to make sure the entire amount doesn\u2019t fall into the hands of scrupulous entities.Nomad has also asked these individuals to send the funds they have withdrawn to dedicated addresses.Nomad says it\u2019s working around the clock to return the funds and has also notified law enforcement. It is also working with chain analysis/intelligence firm TRM Labs to trace the funds and identify recipient wallets to recover the funds.Nomad Bridge Funds Recovery ProcessDear white hat hackers and ethical researcher friends who have been safeguarding ETH/ERC-20 tokens,Please send the funds to the following wallet address on Ethereum: 0x94A84433101A10aEda762968f6995c574D1bF154 pic.twitter.com/UF623JSZ8uIt is worth knowing that more than $1.8 billion in crypto has been stolen due to these bridge hacks over the past couple of years. The fact that these bridges are deployed in such a hurry without a proper audit leads to hackers exploiting these vulnerabilities.Even the creator of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, has talked about his pessimism towards bridges, as they are still some of the most vulnerable when it comes to hacks.This breach exacerbates the whole situation for the crypto community as it might be perceived as a crypto hack (which it is not).Crypto is going through one of its worst phases and the news of any hacks related to crypto platforms is dissuading people from investing in tech. There is a dire need to be more proactive when it comes to the development of such underlying technologies so that these vulnerabilities can be nipped in the bud.",

The next opportunity to launch will only open in late September and early October.\"Because of the complex orbital mechanics involved in launching to the Moon, we would have had to launch Artemis I by Tuesday, Sept. 6 as part of the current launch period,\" Nasa had updated. However, the developments indicate it is unlikely to happen.Nasa Administrator Bill Nelson stressed that safety is the top priority, especially on a test flight like this where everyone wants to verify the rocket\u2019s systems \u201cbefore we put four humans up on the top of it.\u201dAlso Read | Artemis-1 suffers fuel leak, second launch attempt scrubbedMeanwhile, engineers are working to fix the hydrogen leak in a quick disconnect, an interface between the liquid hydrogen fuel feed line and the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. The second attempt to launch was scrubbed on Saturday after the leak was detected and despite several attempts, engineers failed to fix it.Hydrogen molecules are exceedingly small \u2014 the smallest in existence \u2014 and even the tiniest gap or crevice can provide a way out. Nasa\u2019s space shuttles, now retired, were plagued by hydrogen leaks. The new moon rocket uses the same type of main engines.Mission manager Mike Sarafin told journalists it was too early to tell what caused the leak, but it may have been due to inadvertent over-pressurization of the hydrogen line earlier in the morning when someone sent commands to the wrong valve.\"Teams will conduct a schedule assessment to provide additional data that will inform a decision on whether to perform work to replace a seal either at the pad, where it can be tested under cryogenic conditions, or inside the Vehicle Assembly Building,\" Nasa has said in a blog update.With the launch window only opening up in late September, the Artemis team will have to roll the rocket and spacecraft back to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) before the next launch attempts to reset the system\u2019s batteries.Also Read | Isro successfully tests IAD technology to land missions on Mars, VenusThe previous try on Monday at launching the 322-foot Space Launch System rocket, the most powerful ever built by Nasa, was also troubled by hydrogen leaks, though they were smaller. That was on top of leaks detected during countdown drills earlier in the year.Nasa already has been waiting years to send the crew capsule atop the rocket around the moon.

It is not for that.

So the ways and which we want to strengthen... the RBI and the Ministry are fairly engaged in it\u201dThe finance minister also said that the Indian rupee had performed better than its peers. ''We have withstood the impact of the US Fed's decisions much better than any other peer currency,'' she told the house.Actually, if you compare the Indian rupee versus other currencies, it is appreciating in its value, she said, urging the members to understand the context and speak about the Indian rupee.Earlier, TMC member Luizinho Faleiro had claimed that in the last six months, the rupee had depreciated 28 times by 34 per cent and foreign reserves declined to USD 572 billion by mid-July.",

Engineers tried to fix the issue but the leak remained.The launch preparation had initially begun by loading nearly a million gallons of fuel into the 322-foot (98-meter) rocket. However, an over-pressure alarm was sounded and the tanking operation had to be briefly halted, but it did not lead to any damage and the effort resumed.Minutes later, engineers detected hydrogen fuel leaking from the engine section at the bottom of the rocket, forcing the tanking operation to be stopped as troubleshooting began. It was believed to be a gap around a seal in the supply line as the countdown clock remained active.\"Engineers are continuing troubleshooting efforts to address a liquid hydrogen leak in a cavity in the quick disconnect where the flight side and ground side plates join. They once again will attempt to warm up the quick disconnect to try to reset the seal,\" Nasa said in an update before scrubbing the launch.The leak was not the same as was detected on Monday. They had, on Monday, noticed a hydrogen leak on a component of the tail service mast umbilical quick disconnect, called the purge can, and managed the leak by manually adjusting propellant flow rates.Even more of a problem on Monday, a sensor indicated one of the rocket\u2019s four engines was too warm, but engineers later verified it actually was cold enough.

It was followed by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea Ltd.New entrant Adani group is said to have bought 26 Mhz spectrum for setting up a private telecom network.The sources said details of which company bought how much spectrum would be known once the data from the auction is fully compiled.ALSO READ| 5G spectrum auction to start on Tuesday; Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel among 4 cos in frayBoth Bharti and Jio have likely built a pan-India spectrum footprint for 5G, with Vodafone Idea's selective participation.The government had put on offer spectrum in 10 bands but received no bids for airwaves in 600 MHz, 800 MHz and 2300 MHz bands. About two-thirds of the bids were for the 5G bands (3300 Mhz and 26 GHz), while more than a quarter of the demand came in the 700 Mhz band - a band that had gone unsold in the previous two auctions (2016 and 2021).In the auction conducted last year - that had lasted two days - Reliance Jio picked up spectrum worth Rs 57,122.65 crore, Bharti Airtel bid about Rs 18,699 crore, and Vodafone Idea bought spectrum worth Rs 1,993.40 crore.This year, a total of 72 GHz (gigahertz) of radiowaves worth at least Rs 4.3 lakh crore was put on the block. The auction was held for spectrum in various low (600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, 2500 MHz), mid (3300 MHz) and high (26 GHz) frequency bands.In addition to powering ultra-low latency connections, which allow downloading full-length high-quality video or movie to a mobile device in a matter of seconds (even in crowded areas), Fifth Generation or 5G would enable solutions such as e-health, connected vehicles, more-immersive augmented reality and metaverse experiences, life-saving use cases, and advanced mobile cloud gaming among others.The auction garnered bids worth Rs 1.45 lakh crore on the first day on July 26, with subsequent days seeing only marginal incremental demand in some circles.",

    "content": "Over 1000 people have lost their lives, lakhs are displaced and the government is in chaos as extreme weather events trigger floods in several parts of Pakistan. The floods are not just the result of extreme weather hitting the country, the glaciers melting in the Himalayas have worsened the crisis.Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Indore have recorded extreme melting in the Himalayan glaciers due to intense summer and heatwaves earlier this year. They have been tracking the extent of snow cover, ice formations, and discharge from seasonal snowmelt for over 15 years.\"We had installed it in June and by August we couldn't even find the remnants. We had an intense heat wave in early summer when temperatures in March and April broke 100-year records. And we have had resulting glacial melt. Our team was on a glacier last week and we have seen record-breaking melt in the Himalayas,\" Mohammad Farooq Azam, a glaciologist at IIT Indore told Bloomberg.While extra rains swelled the rivers in Pakistan, the extreme heat accelerated the long-term glacier melting, speeding down water from the Himalayas to Pakistan in a dangerous phenomenon called glacial lake outburst floods.Glaciers are made of layers of compressed snow that move or \u201cflow\u201d due to gravity and the softness of ice relative to rock. A glacier\u2019s \u201ctongue\u201d can extend hundreds of kilometers (miles) from its high-altitude origins, and the end, or \u201csnout,\u201d can advance or retreat based on snow accumulating or melting.Also Read | Amazon fires hits five-year high in August, illegal deforestation surgesWhile the glacier melts have been intensifying in the Himalayas, it is not a lone event. Similar events have also been observed in Europe's Alps. The worrying part about the Himalayas is that it stores the largest reserve of frozen freshwater outside the north and south poles.A previous study conducted by IIT Indore in 2021 revealed melting of glaciers and snow are important components in the region and if it continues through the century, it may one day stop supplying water altogether. While the melting glaciers fulfill the water requirements of more than a billion people in the region, an intense melt could also lead to water shortages in the future.Researchers last year also estimated that the glaciers have lost around 40 per cent of their area, shrinking from a peak of 28,000 square kilometers to around 19,600 sq kilometers in 2021. During that period they also lost 390 cubic kilometers of ice.Also Read | Climate change: Zimbabwe moves 2,500 wild animals to save them from droughtThe continuous melting has led to 30 million people being affected in Pakistan, submerging not just farmlands but also cities. There\u2019s been a 400% increase in average rainfall in areas like Baluchistan and Sindh with over 20 dams breaching their thresholds.Pakistan saw similar flooding and devastation in 2010 that killed nearly 2,000 people.Also Read | Webb telescope finds planet bigger than Jupiter outside Solar System",

    "content": "The U.S. government is drastically underestimating the social cost of carbon dioxide emissions, which is 3.6 times higher than the estimate currently used to inform many of Washington's key climate policies, a study suggested on Thursday.Carbon dioxide is the greenhouse gas chiefly responsible for global warming and therefore negatively affects human wellbeing. U.S. economists call this the \"social cost\" and they calculate it in dollars, considering repercussions such as changes in agricultural productivity, damages from sea level rise and worsening human health.The U.S. currently puts that cost at around $51 per metric tonne \u2014 a figure which dates back to the Obama administration, adjusted for inflation. But in research published Thursday in the journal Nature, a team of American scientists say the reality of such damages is likely far greater, at $185 per tonne.That's important because \"higher estimates of the social cost motivate more ambitious mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions,\" said co-author Brian Prest, an economist at the non-profit Resources for the Future.The U.S. federal government relies on the social cost figure to inform standards for vehicle and power plant emissions and the energy efficiency of appliances. It is also used as a basis for federal tax credits on carbon capture and storage, zero emission credit payments for nuclear generators and in proposed federal carbon tax legislation.But a 2017 report by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine called out the federal government for using outdated research to calculate the consequences of greenhouse gas emissions.The government's social cost estimate relied on old climate models that generated global temperature changes inconsistent with those predicted by more sophisticated Earth systems models, the Nature study said. The estimate also did not incorporate a growing body of research on how climate change is expected to affect human wellbeing, it added.The Trump administration then slashed the social cost estimate to below $10 per metric tonne. This allowed federal agencies to roll back fuel economy standards.Last year, U.S. President Joe Biden reinstated the Obama-era $51 social cost as a temporary measure and re-established the Interagency Working Group on the Social Costs of Greenhouse Gases.Members of the working group did not respond to a request for comment. They are expected to release an updated social cost estimate later this year.Prest and his colleagues hope the government will consider their research, which relies on improved socioeconomic projections, climate models, climate impact assessments and economic discounting, or the value that researchers today put on costs incurred by future generations.\"The higher the social cost of carbon, the better off future generations will be,\" said Jim Krane, an energy policy expert at Rice University in Texas.Though other countries, including Germany, Canada and Mexico, also use a social cost of CO2 in policy decisions, \"the U.S. is the biggest user of the social cost of CO2,\" said Prest.Canada currently prices CO2 emissions at $50 CAD per metric tonne - below the United States. However, Canada's government acknowledges that is an underestimate and says it is \"committed to revising the social cost of carbon\".\"We're certainly pushing and asking other countries to consider pollution-pricing systems,\" Oliver Anderson, a spokesman for Canadian Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault, said.Germany's Environmental Agency lists the social cost of CO2 at 180 euros ($178.92) per metric tonne of emissions.",

During the session, the local unit witnessed an intra-day high of 79.64 and a low of 79.85 against the American currency.The rupee finally settled at 79.69, registering a rise of 22 paise over its previous close. On Wednesday, the rupee declined 13 paise to close at 79.91 against the US dollar.The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised key interest rates by 75 basis points for the second straight month.According to Sugandha Sachdeva, Vice President Commodity and Currency Research, Religare Broking, the Indian rupee has managed to clinch gains of around 0.30 per cent as the slide in the US dollar on the back of less hawkish US Fed rhetoric has boosted \u201crisk on\u201d sentiments in the markets and supported the local unit.\u201cThe US Fed has delivered a second consecutive 0.75 percentage point rate hike on expected lines to stamp out scorching inflation, but has stopped short of providing any clear guidance about the pace and quantum of future rate hikes,\u201d Sachdeva said.On the domestic equity market front, the BSE Sensex ended 1,041.47 points or 1.87 per cent higher at 56,857.79, while the broader NSE Nifty jumped 287.80 points or 1.73 per cent to 16,929.60.Markets are now hopeful that the US Fed might slow down the pace of its monetary tightening campaign amid waning growth momentum signalled by several high-frequency economic indicators.Besides, strength in domestic equities has further underpinned the local unit. However, steady crude oil prices are still acting as a key headwind and capping gains in the local unit, Sachdeva noted.\u201cLooking ahead, we foresee the Indian rupee to face initial resistance at the 79.40 mark, and only a move past the same would open the doorway for further appreciation towards the 79 mark in the near-term,\u201d Sachdeva said.Foreign institutional investors turned net buyers in the capital markets as they picked up shares worth Rs 1,637.69 crore on Thursday, as per exchange data.The dollar index, which measures the greenback\u2019s strength against a basket of six currencies, was up 0.12 per cent at 106.58.Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, rose 1.37 per cent to USD 108.08 per barrel.\u201cRupee traded positive on the back of positive capital markets and negative dollar reaction after Fed\u2019s 0.75 bps hike with a data-driven further stance from Fed chair Powell,\u201d said Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst at LKP Securities.Trivedi further said that \u201chigher crude prices kept gains limited in rupee.

    "content": "More fires burned in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest this August than in any month in nearly five years, thanks to a surge in illegal deforestation.Satellite sensors detected 33,116 fires according to Brazil\u2019s national space institute. The dry season months of August and September are usually worst for both deforestation and fire.It was also the worst August for fire in 12 years. That includes August of 2019, when images of the burning rainforest shocked the world and drew criticism from European leaders. Bolsonaro had recently taken office and was turning environmental enforcement on its head, saying criminals should not be fined and promising development of the Amazon.The far-right president downplayed the raging fires then and continues to do so today. He told media network Globo on Aug. 22 \u2014 the worst single day for outbreaks of fire in 15 years \u2014 that the criticism is part of an effort to undermine the nation\u2019s agribusiness sector.\u201cBrazil does not deserve to be attacked in this way,\u201d said Bolsonaro, who is campaigning for reelection.Also Read | Israeli archaeologists dig up large tusk of ancient elephantThe fires are evident even several hundred miles away in the Amazon\u2019s largest city, Manaus, where smoke has hung in the sky for weeks.Fire in the Amazon is almost always deliberately set, primarily to improve cattle pasture or burn recently-felled trees once they are dry. Often the fires burn out of control and spread into pristine areas of the forest.After a calm period with unusually high rainfall in early August, blazes began spreading rapidly, said Ane Alencar, coordinator of the Mapbiomas Fire project, run by a network of nonprofits, universities and tech startups.\u201cThe deforestation rate is very high. That means there are many fallen trees ready to burn,\u201d Alencar told The Associated Press in a Zoom interview. The fire season will be even more intense in September.\u201dAbout 20% of the area burned in the Amazon this year was deforested recently. Some is within protected areas that are targeted by land-grabbers, according to an analysis by the Center of Life Institute, a Brazilian non-profit, based on NASA\u2019s Global Fire Emissions Database.Also Read | What is qHPV? India's first homemade vaccine for cervical cancerOne example is Cristalino II State Park in Mato Grosso, a protected area recently declared illegal by a state court. The state prosecutors office appealed that decision, but the legal dissolution seemed to give license to deforesters, unleashing a wave of destruction. In just the past few weeks, fire has destroyed nearly 40 square kilometers (15 square miles) in the park, despite the presence of firefighters, according to the Center of Life Institute.Widespread fire means Brazil is failing to curb greenhouse gas emissions, as almost half the country\u2019s carbon pollution comes from land conversion. The Amazon rainforest is an important carbon absorber for the planet, but burning timber releases that carbon into the atmosphere.During the COP26 climate summit earlier this year, the Bolsonaro government promised to stop all illegal deforestation by 2028. So far during his tenure, forest loss has surged to a 15-year high.\u201cIf Brazil wants to reduce its carbon emissions, the number one thing to do is reduce deforestation. And the second is to reduce the use of fire,\u201d Alencar said.Also Read | Climate change: Zimbabwe moves 2,500 wild animals to save them from drought",

Dubbed HIP 65426 b, the planet is about 12 times the mass of Jupiter and is about 15 to 20 million years old, compared to our 4.5-billion-year-old Earth.The planet was first spotted in 2017 using the SPHERE instrument on the European Southern Observatory\u2019s Very Large Telescope in Chile. While the telescope looked at it in short infrared wavelengths, Webb peered into it in longer infrared wavelengths revealing new details.The planet is about 100 times farther from its host star than Earth is from the Sun, making it easier to be spotted by Webb and the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) are capable of picking it up from the distance. While the planet is 10,000 times fainter than its host star, the two equipment on Webb block out starlight, enabling it to take direct images of certain exoplanets like this one.Nasa said that the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, slated to launch later this decade, will demonstrate an even more advanced coronagraph.Also Read | Russian cosmonauts to conduct spacewalk.
